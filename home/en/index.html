Our group develops advanced algorithms for efficient processing, reliable reconstruction and automated information extraction Formation
multidimensional microscopy datasets, predominantly in electron and X-ray microscopy. We have expertise in deep learning,
large-scale optimization, signal and image processing, and experimental design for advanced X-ray and electron microscopy experiments.
We strive to not only develop algorithms, but also optimize the data acquisition and experimental design to achieve accelerated and enhanced
materials characterization.
