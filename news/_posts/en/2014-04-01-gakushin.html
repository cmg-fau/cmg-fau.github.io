<p class="lead">Congratulations to the three doctoral students in our group, Yu Komatsu, Takanobu Kirihara, and Hiroyuki Suzuki, who have been awarded the JSPS Research Fellowship for Young Scientists.</p>


<h5>Yu Komatsu (DC2)</h5>

<p>PhD 3rd Year</p>

<p><strong>Project title: Modeling photosynthetic biomarkers of extrasolar planets: Quantum mechanical calculations of the light harvesting mechanism</strong></p>

<p>We plan to investigate the habitability of extrasolar planets by exploring and combining a variety of techniques beyond the standard ones used in this field. </p>

<br />

<h5>Hiroyuki Suzuki (DC1)</h5>

<p>PhD 1st Year</p>

<p><strong>Project title: Studying galaxy formation using radiation hydrodynamics simulations including a combined physical model of supernova explosions and UV radiation from massive stars</strong></p>

<p>We aim to pinpoint the physical processes that determine the basic charactaristics of galaxies, such as morphology.</p>

<br />

<h5>Takanobu Kirihara (DC1)</h5>

<p>PhD 1st Year</p>

<p><strong>Project title: Investigating the formation of the local group via large-scale cosmological simulations</strong></p>

<p>Guided by data of our local group of galaxies, and in particular the Andromeda galaxy, we seek to elucidate the process of galaxy group formation in unprecedented detail.</p>
