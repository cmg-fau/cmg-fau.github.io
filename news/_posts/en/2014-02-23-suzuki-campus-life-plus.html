<p>Today, second year Masters student Hiroyuki Suzuki from our group attended the finals of the "Campus Life +1" contest and gave a presentation about his dreams  and ambitions in life. His dream is to make many people smile and happy by sharing his fascination with the universe. From 2,000 participants from all over Japan, Suzuki won first prize. "To be honest, I didn't think my presentation went that well, and I thought I had blown it, but the judges were impressed and convinced by my dreams and the activities I have been dedicated to, so I am very happy. I will keep on working hard to fulfill my dreams." says Suzuki.</p>
