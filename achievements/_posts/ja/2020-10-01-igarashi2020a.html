abstract: We investigate the origin of the soft X-ray excess component in Seyfert
  galaxies observed when their luminosity exceeds 0.1% of the Eddington luminosity
  ( $L_\mathrmEdd$ ). The evolution of a dense blob in radiatively inefficient accretion
  flow (RIAF) is simulated by applying a radiation magnetohydrodynamic code, CANS+R.
  When the accretion rate onto a $10^7\,M_ødot $ black hole exceeds 10% of the Eddington
  accretion rate ( $\dotM_\mathrmEdd=L_\mathrmEdd/c^2$ , where c is the speed of light),
  the dense blob shrinks vertically because of radiative cooling and forms a Thomson
  thick, relatively cool (\ensuremath∼10$^7-8$ K) region. The cool region coexists
  with the optically thin, hot ( $T∼ 10^11\,m̊K$ ) RIAF near the black hole. The cool
  disk is responsible for the soft X-ray emission, while hard X-rays are emitted from
  the hot inner accretion flow. Such a hybrid structure of hot and cool accretion
  flows is consistent with the observations of both hard and soft X-ray emissions
  from ``changing-look'' active galactic nuclei (CLAGNs). Furthermore, we find that
  quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are excited in the soft X-ray-emitting region.
  These oscillations can be the origin of rapid X-ray time variabilities observed
  in CLAGNs.
