abstract: We present the results of infrared L-band (3-4\ensuremathμm) slit spectroscopy
  of 30 PG QSOs at z &lt; 0.17, a representative sample of local high-luminosity,
  optically selected AGNs. The 3.3\ensuremathμm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
  emission feature is used to probe nuclear (&lt; a few kpc) starburst activity and
  to investigate the connections between AGNs and nuclear starbursts in PG QSOs. The
  3.3\ensuremathμm PAH emission is detected in the individual spectra of 5/30 of the
  observed PG QSOs. We constructed a composite spectrum of PAH-undetected PG QSOs
  and discerned the presence of the 3.3\ensuremathμm PAH emission therein. We estimated
  the nuclear-starburst and AGN luminosities from the observed 3.3\ensuremathμm PAH
  emission and 3.35\ensuremathμm continuum luminosities, respectively, and found that
  the nuclear-starburst-to-AGN luminosity ratios in PG QSOs are similar to those of
  previously studied AGN populations with lower luminosities, suggesting that AGN-nuclear
  starburst connections are valid over a wide luminosity range of AGNs in the local
  universe. The observed nuclear-starburst-to-AGN luminosity ratios in PG QSOs with
  available supermassive black-hole masses are comparable to a theoretical prediction
  based on the assumption that the growth of a supermassive black hole is controlled
  by starburst-induced turbulence.
