abstract: The collapse and fragmentation of filamentary primordial gas clouds are
  explored using one- and two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations coupled with
  the nonequilibrium processes of hydrogen molecule formation. The cloud evolution
  is computed from the initial central density n$_c$=10-10$^6$ cm$^-3$. The simulations
  show that depending on the initial density, there are two occasions for the fragmentation
  of primordial filaments. If a filament has relatively low initial density such as
  n$_c$&lt;åisebox-0.5ex~10$^5$ cm$^-3$, the radial contraction is slow as a result
  of less effective H$_2$ cooling and appreciably decelerates at densities higher
  than a critical density, where LTE populations are achieved for the rotational levels
  of H$_2$ molecules and the cooling timescale becomes accordingly longer than the
  free- fall timescale. This filament tends to fragment into dense clumps before the
  central density reaches 10$^8$-10$^9$ cm$^-3$, where H$_2$ cooling by three-body
  reactions is effective and the fragment mass is more massive than some tens of M$_solar$.
  In contrast, if a filament is initially as dense as n$_c$&gt;\i̊sebox-0.5ex~10$^5$
  cm$^-3$, the more effective H$_2$ cooling with the help of three-body reactions
  allows the filament to contract up to n\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~10$^12$ cm$^-3$. After the
  density reaches n\rae̊box-0.5ex~10$^12$ cm$^-3$, the filament becomes optically
  thick to H$_2$ lines and the radial contraction subsequently almost stops. At this
  final hydrostatic stage, the fragment mass is lowered down to \raib̊ox-0.5ex~1 M$_solar$
  because of the high density of the filament. The dependence of the fragment mass
  upon the initial density could be translated into the dependence on the local amplitude
  of random Gaussian density fields or the epoch of the collapse of a parent cloud.
  Hence, it is predicted that the initial mass function of Population III stars is
  likely to be bimodal with peaks of \raiso̊x-0.5ex~10$^2$ and \raisex̊-0.5ex~1 M$_solar$,
  where the relative heights could be a function of the collapse epoch. Implications
  for the metal enrichment by Population III stars at high redshifts and baryonic
  dark matter are briefly discussed.
