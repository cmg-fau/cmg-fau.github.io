abstract: We present a new magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation package with the aim
  of providing accurate numerical solutions to astrophysical phenomena where discontinuities,
  shock waves, and turbulence are inherently important. The code implements the Harten-Lax-van
  Leer-discontinuitues (HLLD) approximate Riemann solver, the fifth-order-monotonicity-preserving
  interpolation (MP5) scheme, and the hyperbolic divergence cleaning method for a
  magnetic field. This choice of schemes has significantly improved numerical accuracy
  and stability, and saved computational costs in multidimensional problems. Numerical
  tests of one- and two- dimensional problems show the advantages of using the high-order
  scheme by comparing with results from a standard second-order total variation diminishing
  monotonic upwind scheme for conservation laws (MUSCL) scheme. The present code enables
  us to explore the long-term evolution of a three-dimensional accretion disk around
  a black hole, in which compressible MHD turbulence causes continuous mass accretion
  via nonlinear growth of the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). Numerical tests
  with various computational cell sizes exhibits a convergent picture of the early
  nonlinear growth of the MRI in a global model, and indicates that the MP5 scheme
  has more than twice the resolution of the MUSCL scheme in practical applications.
