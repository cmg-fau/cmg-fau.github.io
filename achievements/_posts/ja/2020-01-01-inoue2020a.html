abstract: We study the gravitational instability and fragmentation of primordial protostellar
  discs by using high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamics simulations. We follow
  the formation and evolution of spiral arms in protostellar discs, examine the dynamical
  stability, and identify a physical mechanism of secondary protostar formation. We
  use linear perturbation theory based on the spiral-arm instability (SAI) analysis
  in our previous studies. We improve the analysis by incorporating the effects of
  finite thickness and shearing motion of arms, and derive the physical conditions
  for SAI in protostellar discs. Our analysis predicts accurately the stability and
  the onset of arm fragmentation that is determined by the balance between self- gravity
  and gas pressure plus the Coriolis force. Formation of secondary and multiple protostars
  in the discs is explained by the SAI, which is driven by self-gravity and thus can
  operate without rapid gas cooling. We can also predict the typical mass of the fragments,
  which is found to be in good agreement with the actual masses of secondary protostars
  formed in the simulation.
