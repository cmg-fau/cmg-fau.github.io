abstract: We present the ionized gas properties of infrared (IR)-bright dust- obscured
  galaxies (DOGs) that show an extreme optical/IR color, \(i-[22])\$_\AB$\&gt; 7.0,
  selected with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Wide-field Infrared Survey
  Explorer (WISE). For 36 IR-bright DOGs that show [O III]\ensuremathłambda5007 emission
  in the SDSS spectra, we performed a detailed spectral analysis to investigate their
  ionized gas properties. In particular, we measured the velocity offset (the velocity
  with respect to the systemic velocity measured from the stellar absorption lines)
  and the velocity dispersion of the [O III] line. We found that the derived velocity
  offset and dispersion of most IR-bright DOGs are larger than those of Seyfert 2
  galaxies (Sy2s) at z&lt; 0.3, meaning that the IR-bright DOGs show relatively strong
  outflows compared to Sy2s. This can be explained by the difference in IR luminosity
  contributed from active galactic nuclei, \L\$_\IR$\ (AGN), because we found that
  (i) \L\$_\IR$\ (AGN) correlates with the velocity offset and dispersion of [O III]
  and (ii) our IR-bright DOG sample has larger \L\$_\IR$\ (AGN) than Sy2s. Nevertheless,
  the fact that about 75% IR-bright DOGs have a large (&gt;300 km s$^-1$) velocity
  dispersion, which is a larger fraction compared to other AGN populations, suggests
  that IR-bright DOGs are good laboratories to investigate AGN feedback. The velocity
  offset and dispersion of [O III] and [Ne III]\ensuremathłambda3869 are larger than
  those of [O II]\ensuremathłambda3727, which indicates that the highly ionized gas
  tends to show stronger outflows.
