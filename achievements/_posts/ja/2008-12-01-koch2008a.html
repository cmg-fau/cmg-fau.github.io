abstract: The halo of M31 shows a wealth of substructures, some of which are consistent
  with assembly from satellite accretion. Here we report on kinematic and abundance
  results from Keck DEIMOS spectroscopy in the near-infrared calcium triplet region
  of over 3500 red giant star candidates along the minor axis and in off- axis spheroid
  fields of M31. These data reach out to large radial distances of about 160 kpc.
  The derived radial velocity distributions show an indication of a kinematically
  cold substructure around åisebox-0.5ex~17 kpc, which has been reported before. We
  devise a new and improved method to measure spectroscopic metallicities from the
  calcium triplet in low signal-to-noise ratio spectra using a weighted co-addition
  of the individual lines. The resulting distribution (accurate to \i̊sebox-0.5ex~0.3
  dex down to signal-to-noise ratios of 5) leads us to note an even stronger gradient
  in the abundance distribution along M31's minor axis and in particular toward the
  outer halo fields than previously detected. The mean metallicity in the outer fields
  reaches below -2 dex, with individual values as low as lesssim-2.6 dex. This is
  the first time such a metal-poor halo has been detected in M31. In the fields toward
  the inner spheroid, we find a sharp decline of \rs̊ebox-0.5ex~0.5 dex in metallicity
  in a region at \rae̊box-0.5ex~20 kpc, which roughly coincides with the edge of an
  extended disk, previously detected from star count maps. A large fraction of red
  giants that we detect in the most distant fields are likely members of M33's overlapping
  halo. A comparison of our velocities with those predicted by new N-body simulations
  argues that the event responsible for the Giant Stream is most likely not responsible
  for the full population of the inner halo. We show further that the abundance distribution
  of the Stream is different from that of the inner halo, from which it becomes evident,
  in turn, that the merger event that formed the Stream and the outer halo cannot
  have contributed any significant material to the inner spheroid. All these severe
  structure changes in the halo suggest a high degree of infall and stochastic abundance
  accretion governing the buildup of M31's inner and outer halo. <P />Some of the
  data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated
  as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University
  of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory
  was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.
