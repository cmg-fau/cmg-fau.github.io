abstract: We investigate the properties of accretion flows on to a black hole (BH)
  with a mass of M$_BH$ embedded in an initially uniform gas cloud with a density
  of n$_\ensuremathınfty$ in order to study rapid growth of BHs in the early Universe.
  In previous work, the conditions required for super-Eddington accretion from outside
  the Bondi radius were studied by assuming that radiation produced at the vicinity
  of the central BH has a single power- law spectrum \ensuremathν$^-\ensuremathα$
  at h\ensuremathν \ensuremath≥ 13.6 eV (\ensuremathα ̃ 1.5). However, radiation spectra
  surely depend on the BH mass and accretion rate, and determine the efficiency of
  radiative feedback. Here, we perform two- dimensional multifrequency radiation hydrodynamical
  simulations taking into account more realistic radiation spectra associated with
  the properties of nuclear accretion discs. We find that the critical density of
  gas surrounding the BH, above which transitions to super-Eddington accretion occur,
  is alleviated for a wide range of masses of seed BHs (10 \ensuremathłesssim M$_BH$/M$_☉$
  \ensuremathłesssim 10$^6$) because photoionization for accretion disc spectra are
  less efficient than those for single power-law spectra with 1 \ensuremathłesssim
  \ensuremathα \ensuremathłesssim 3. For disc spectra, the transition to super-Eddington
  is more likely to occur for lower BH masses because the radiation spectra become
  too hard to ionize the gas. Even when accretion flows are exposed to anisotropic
  radiation, the effect due to radiation spectra shrinks the ionized region and likely
  leads to the transition to a wholly neutral accretion phase. Finally, by generalizing
  our simulation results, we construct a new analytical criterion required for super-
  Eddington accretion; (M_BH/105̂ M_☉) (n_\\ensuremathınfty\/10\ ̂cm\^3̂\) \ensuremath\gtrsim
  2.4 (&lt; \ensuremathın &gt; /100 eV)\^\/̂9\, where &lt;\ensuremathın&gt; is the
  mean energy of ionizing radiation from the central BH.
