abstract: We develop new numerical schemes for Vlasov-Poisson equations with high-
  order accuracy. Our methods are based on a spatially monotonicity-preserving (MP)
  scheme and are modified suitably so that the positivity of the distribution function
  is also preserved. We adopt an efficient semi-Lagrangian time integration scheme
  that is more accurate and computationally less expensive than the three-stage TVD
  Runge-Kutta integration. We apply our spatially fifth- and seventh-order schemes
  to a suite of simulations of collisionless self-gravitating systems and electrostatic
  plasma simulations, including linear and nonlinear Landau damping in one dimension
  and Vlasov-Poisson simulations in a six-dimensional phase space. The high-order
  schemes achieve a significantly improved accuracy in comparison with the third-order
  positive-flux-conserved scheme adopted in our previous study. With the semi-Lagrangian
  time integration, the computational cost of our high-order schemes does not significantly
  increase, but remains roughly the same as that of the third-order scheme. Vlasov-Poisson
  simulations on \128\$^3$Ã— \128\$^3$ mesh grids have been successfully performed
  on a massively parallel computer.
