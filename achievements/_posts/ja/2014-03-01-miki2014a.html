abstract: In the hierarchical structure formation scenario, galaxies enlarge through
  multiple merging events with less massive galaxies. In addition, the Magorrian relation
  indicates that almost all galaxies are occupied by a central supermassive black
  hole (SMBH) of mass 10$^-3$ times the mass of its spheroidal component. Consequently,
  SMBHs are expected to wander in the halos of their host galaxies following a galaxy
  collision, although evidence of this activity is currently lacking. We investigate
  a current plausible location of an SMBH wandering in the halo of the Andromeda galaxy
  (M31). According to theoretical studies of N-body simulations, some of the many
  substructures in the M31 halo are remnants of a minor merger occurring about 1 Gyr
  ago. First, to evaluate the possible parameter space of the infalling orbit of the
  progenitor, we perform numerous parameter studies using a graphics processing unit
  cluster. To reduce uncertainties in the predicted position of the expected SMBH,
  we then calculate the time evolution of the SMBH in the progenitor dwarf galaxy
  from N-body simulations using the plausible parameter sets. Our results show that
  the SMBH lies within the halo (åisebox-0.5ex~20-50 kpc from the M31 center), closer
  to the Milky Way than the M31 disk. Furthermore, the predicted current positions
  of the SMBH were restricted to an observational field of 0.°6 × 0.°7 in the northeast
  region of the M31 halo. We also discuss the origin of the infalling orbit of the
  satellite galaxy and its relationships with the recently discovered vast thin disk
  plane of satellite galaxies around M31.
