abstract: We report the result from observations conducted with the Atacama Large
  Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to detect [C II] 158 \ensuremathμm fine structure
  line emission from galaxies embedded in one of the most spectacular Ly\ensuremathα
  blobs (LABs) at z = 3.1, SSA22-LAB1. Of three dusty star-forming galaxies previously
  discovered by ALMA 860 \ensuremathμm dust continuum survey toward SSA22-LAB1, we
  detected the [C II] line from one, LAB1-ALMA3 at z = 3.0993 \ensuremath± 0.0004.
  No line emission was detected, associated with the other ALMA continuum sources
  or from three rest-frame UV/optical selected z$_spec$ ≃ 3.1 galaxies within the
  field of view. For LAB1-ALMA3, we find relatively bright [C II] emission compared
  to the infrared luminosity (L$_[C II]$/L$_IR$ \ensuremath≈ 0.01) and an extremely
  high [C II] 158 \ensuremathμm and [N II] 205 \ensuremathμm emission line ratio (L$_[C
  II]$/L$_[N II]$ &gt; 55). The relatively strong [C II] emission may be caused by
  abundant photodissociation regions and sub-solar metallicity, or by shock heating.
  The origin of the unusually strong [C II] emission could be causally related to
  the location within the giant LAB, although the relationship between extended Ly\ensuremathα
  emission and interstellar medium conditions of associated galaxies is yet to be
  understand.
