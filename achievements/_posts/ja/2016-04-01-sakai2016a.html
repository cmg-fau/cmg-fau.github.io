abstract: Subarcsecond images of the rotational line emission of CS and SO have been
  obtained toward the Class I protostar IRAS 04365+2535 in TMC-1A with ALMA. A compact
  component around the protostar is clearly detected in the CS and SO emission. The
  velocity structure of the compact component of CS reveals infalling- rotating motion
  conserving the angular momentum. It is well explained by a ballistic model of an
  infalling-rotating envelope with the radius of the centrifugal barrier (one-half
  of the centrifugal radius) of 50 au, although the distribution of the infalling
  gas is asymmetric around the protostar. The distribution of SO is mostly concentrated
  around the radius of the centrifugal barrier of the simple model. Thus, a drastic
  change in chemical composition of the gas infalling onto the protostar is found
  to occur at a 50 au scale probably due to accretion shocks, demonstrating that the
  infalling material is significantly processed before being delivered into the disk.
