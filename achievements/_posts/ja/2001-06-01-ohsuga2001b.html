abstract: We consider the radiation-hydrodynamical formation of a dusty wall in the
  circumnuclear regions of the Circinus Seyfert 2 galaxy. We focus on the radiative
  flux force due to the circumnuclear starburst, the nuclear starburst and the active
  galactic nucleus (AGN), and analyze the equilibrium configuration and stability
  of the dusty gas in the circumnuclear regions. The mass distributions used to model
  the gravitational fields are determined by the observed rotation velocities of the
  stars and of the gas. Moreover, by using the simple stellar evolution in the circumnuclear
  starburst, the bolometric luminosity of the starburst is estimated as a function
  of time. As a result, it is shown that the radiation force by the circumnuclear
  starburst does play an important role to build up a radiatively-supported dusty
  wall of la 100 pc, which obscures the circumnuclear regions with A_V of a few magnitudes.
  It is also found that the age of a circumnuclear starburst when the circumnuclear
  regions are enshrouded by the dusty wall is constrained to be la 10$^8$ yr, which
  is consistent with the age observationally inferred for the starburst, 4 10$^7$
  yr-1.5 10$^8$ yr.
