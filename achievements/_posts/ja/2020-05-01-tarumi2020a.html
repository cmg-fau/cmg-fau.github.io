abstract: We study the enrichment and mixing of r-process elements in ultrafaint dwarf
  galaxies (UFDs). We assume that r-process elements are produced by neutron-star
  mergers (NSMs), and examine multiple models with different natal kick velocities
  and explosion energies. To this end, we perform cosmological simulations of galaxy
  formation to follow mixing of the dispersed r-process elements driven by star formation
  and the associated stellar feedback in progenitors of UFDs. We show that the observed
  europium abundance in Reticulum II is reproduced by our inner explosion model where
  an NSM is triggered at the centre of the galaxy, whereas the relatively low abundance
  in Tucana III is reproduced if an NSM occurs near the virial radius of the progenitor
  galaxy. The latter case is realized only if the neutron-star binary has a large
  natal kick velocity and travels over a long distance of a kiloparsec before merger.
  In both the inner and outer explosion cases, it is necessary for the progenitor
  galaxy to sustain prolonged star formation over a few hundred million years after
  the NSM, so that the dispersed r-process elements are well mixed within the interstellar
  medium. Short-duration star formation results in inefficient mixing, and then a
  large variation is imprinted in the stellar europium abundances, which is inconsistent
  with the observations of Reticulum II and Tucana III.
