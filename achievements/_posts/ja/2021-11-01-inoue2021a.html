<p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >We study the fragmentation of collisional ring galaxies (CRGs) using a linear perturbation
analysis that computes the physical conditions of gravitational instability, as determined by
the balance of self-gravity of the ring against pressure and Coriolis forces. We adopt our
formalism to simulations of CRGs and show that the analysis can accurately characterize the
stability and onset of fragmentation, although the linear theory appears to underpredict the
number of fragments of an unstable CRG by a factor of 2. In addition, since the orthodox
&#8217;density- wave&#8217; model is inapplicable to such self-gravitating rings, we devise a simple
approach that describes the rings propagating as material waves. We find that the toy model
can predict whether the simulated CRGs fragment or not using information from their
pre-collision states. We also apply our instability analysis to a CRG discovered at a high
redshift, z = 2.19. We find that a quite high-velocity dispersion is required for the stability of
the ring, and therefore the CRG should be unstable to ring fragmentation. CRGs
are rarely observed at high redshifts, and this may be because CRGs are usually
too faint. Since the fragmentation can induce active star formation and make the
ring bright enough to observe, the instability could explain this rarity. An unstable
CRG fragments into massive clumps retaining the initial disc rotation, and thus it
would evolve into a clumpy galaxy with a low surface density in an interclump
region.</p>
