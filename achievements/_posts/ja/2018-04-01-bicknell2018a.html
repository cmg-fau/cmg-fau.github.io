abstract: We propose that Gigahertz Peak Spectrum (GPS) and Compact Steep Spectrum
  (CSS) radio sources are the signposts of relativistic jet feedback in evolving galaxies.
  Our simulations of relativistic jets interacting with a warm, inhomogeneous medium,
  utilizing cloud densities and velocity dispersions in the range derived from optical
  observations, show that free-free absorption can account for the Ìƒ GHz peak frequencies
  and low-frequency power laws inferred from the radio observations. These new computational
  models replace a power-law model for the free-free optical depth a more fundamental
  model involving disrupted log- normal distributions of warm gas. One feature of
  our new models is that at early stages, the low-frequency spectrum is steep but
  progressively flattens as a result of a broader distribution of optical depths,
  suggesting that the steep low-frequency spectra discovered by Callingham et al.
  may possibly be attributed to young sources. We also investigate the inverse correlation
  between peak frequency and size and find that the initial location on this correlation
  is determined by the average density of the warm ISM. The simulated sources track
  this correlation initially but eventually fall below it, indicating the need for
  a more extended ISM than presently modelled. GPS and CSS sources can potentially
  provide new insights into the phenomenon of AGN feedback since their peak frequencies
  and spectra are indicative of the density, turbulent structure, and distribution
  of gas in the host galaxy.
