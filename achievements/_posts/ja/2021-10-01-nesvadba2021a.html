<p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >It has long been suspected that powerful radio sources may lower the efficiency with which
stars form from the molecular gas in their host galaxy, however so far, alternative
mechanisms, in particular related to the stellar mass distribution in the massive bulges of
their host galaxies, have not been ruled out. We present new, arcsecond-resolution
Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) CO(1<span 
class="txsy-">-</span>0) interferometry, which probes the
spatially resolved, cold molecular gas in the nearby (z = 0.08), massive (M<sub><span

class="tcxr-">× </span>10<sup><span

class="txsy-x-x-74">⊙</span></sub>), isolated, late-type spiral galaxy 2MASSX J23453269<span 
class="txsy-">-</span>044925,
which is outstanding for having two pairs of powerful, giant radio jets, and a bright
X-ray halo of hot circumgalactic gas. The molecular gas is in a massive (M<sub><span 
class="txmi-x-x-74">gas</span></sub> =
2.0 <span 
class="tcxr-">× </span>10<sup><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">10</span></sup> M<sub><span 
class="txsy-x-x-74">⊙</span></sub>), 24 kpc wide, rapidly rotating ring, which is associated with the
inner stellar disk. Broad (FWHM = 70<span 
class="txsy-">-</span>180 km s<sup><span 
class="txsy-x-x-74">-</span><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">1</span></sup>) emission lines with complex
profiles associated with the radio source are seen over large regions in the ring,
indicating gas velocities that are high enough to keep the otherwise marginally
Toomre-stable gas from fragmenting into gravitationally bound, star-forming clouds.
About 1<span 
class="txsy-">-</span>2% of the jet kinetic energy is required to power these motions. Resolved
star-formation rate surface densities derived from Galaxy Evolution Explorer and
Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer fall by factors of 30<span 
class="txsy-">-</span>70 short of expectations
from the standard Kennicutt-Schmidt law of star-forming galaxies, and near gas-
rich early-type galaxies with signatures of star formation that are lowered by jet
feedback. We argue that radio Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) feedback is the only
plausible mechanism to explain the low star-formation rates in this galaxy. Previous
authors have already noted that the X-ray halo of J2345<span 
class="txsy-">-</span>0449 implies a baryon
fraction that is close to the cosmic average, which is very high for a galaxy. We
contrast this finding with other, equally massive, and equally baryon-rich spiral
galaxies without prominent radio sources. Most of the baryons in these galaxies are
in stars, not in the halos. We also discuss the implications of our results for our
general understanding of AGN feedback in massive galaxies. Based on data obtained
with ALMA through program 2019.1.01492.S and with IRAM through program
080-19.</p>
