abstract: By solving the radiative transfer equations, we examine the three- dimensional
  radiative properties of a magnetohydrodynamic accretion flow model conforming to
  the observed spectrum of Sgr A* in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole at
  the Galactic Centre. As a result, we find that the core of the radio emission is
  larger than the size of the event horizon shadow and its peak location is shifted
  from the gravitational centre. We also find that the self-absorbed synchrotron emission
  arising from the superposition of thermal electrons within a few tens of the Schwartzschild
  radius can account for low-frequency spectra below the critical frequency \ensuremathν$_c$
  åisebox-0.5ex~ 10$^12$Hz. Above the critical frequency, the synchrotron self-Compton
  emission from thermal electrons can account for the variable emission found in recent
  near-infrared observations. In contrast to a previous study by Ohsuga, Kato &amp;
  Mineshige, we found that the X-ray spectra arising from bremsstrahlung emission
  of thermal electrons for the different mass accretion rates can be consistent with
  both the flaring state and the quiescent state of Sgr A* observed by Chandra. <P
