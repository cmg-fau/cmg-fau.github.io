abstract: With the recent discovery of a dozen dusty star-forming galaxies and around
  30 quasars at z &gt; 5 that are hyper-luminous in the infrared (\ensuremathμ L $_IR$
  &gt; 10$^13$ L$_☉$, where \ensuremathμ is a lensing magnification factor), the possibility
  has opened up for SPICA, the proposed ESA M5 mid-/far-infrared mission, to extend
  its spectroscopic studies toward the epoch of reionisation and beyond. In this paper,
  we examine the feasibility and scientific potential of such observations with SPICA's
  far-infrared spectrometer SAFARI, which will probe a spectral range (35-230 \ensuremathμm)
  that will be unexplored by ALMA and JWST. Our simulations show that SAFARI is capable
  of delivering good-quality spectra for hyper-luminous infrared galaxies at z = 5
  - 10, allowing us to sample spectral features in the rest-frame mid-infrared and
  to investigate a host of key scientific issues, such as the relative importance
  of star formation versus AGN, the hardness of the radiation field, the level of
  chemical enrichment, and the properties of the molecular gas. From a broader perspective,
  SAFARI offers the potential to open up a new frontier in the study of the early
  Universe, providing access to uniquely powerful spectral features for probing first-generation
  objects, such as the key cooling lines of low-metallicity or metal-free forming
  galaxies (fine-structure and H$_2$ lines) and emission features of solid compounds
  freshly synthesised by Population III supernovae. Ultimately, SAFARI's ability to
  explore the high-redshift Universe will be determined by the availability of sufficiently
  bright targets (whether intrinsically luminous or gravitationally lensed). With
  its launch expected around 2030, SPICA is ideally positioned to take full advantage
  of upcoming wide-field surveys such as LSST, SKA, Euclid, and WFIRST, which are
  likely to provide extraordinary targets for SAFARI. <P />
