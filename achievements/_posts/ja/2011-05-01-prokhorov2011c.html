abstract: '<BR /> Aims: Measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel''dovich (hereafter SZ) effect
  distortion of the cosmic microwave background provide methods to derive the gas
  pressure and temperature of galaxy clusters. Here we study the ability of SZ effect
  observations to derive the electron distribution function (DF) in massive galaxy
  clusters. <BR /> Methods: Our calculations of the SZ effect include relativistic
  corrections considered within the framework of the Wright formalism and use a decomposition
  technique of electron DFs into Fourier series. Using multi-frequency measurements
  of the SZ effect, we find the solution of a linear system of equations that is used
  to derive the Fourier coefficients; we further analyze different frequency samples
  to decrease uncertainties in Fourier coefficient estimations. <BR /> Results: We
  propose a method to derive DFs of electrons using SZ multi-frequency observations
  of massive galaxy clusters. We found that the best frequency sample to derive an
  electron DF includes high frequencies \ensuremathν = 375, 600, 700, 857 GHz. We
  show that it is possible to distinguish a Juttner DF from a Maxwell-Bolzman DF as
  well as from a Juttner DF with the second electron population by means of SZ observations
  for the best frequency sample if the precision of SZ intensity measurements is less
  than 0.1%. We demonstrate by means of 3D hydrodynamic numerical simulations of a
  hot merging galaxy cluster that the morphologies of SZ intensity maps are different
  for frequencies \ensuremathν = 375, 600, 700, 857 GHz. We stress that measurements
  of SZ intensities at these frequencies are a promising tool for studying electron
  distribution functions in galaxy clusters.'
