abstract: High-frequency, high-resolution imaging of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect
  is an important technique to study the complex structures of the atmospheres of
  merging galaxy clusters. Such observations are sensitive to the details of the electron
  spectrum. We show that the morphology of the SZ intensity maps in simulated galaxy
  clusters observed at 345, 600 and 857 GHz are significantly different because of
  SZ relativistic corrections. These differences can be revealed by high-resolution
  imaging instruments. <P />We calculate relativistically corrected SZ intensity maps
  of a simulated, massive, merging galaxy cluster and of the massive, merging clusters
  1E0657-558 (the Bullet cluster) and Abell 2219. The morphologies of the SZ intensity
  maps are remarkably different between 345 and 857 GHz for each merging cluster.
  We show that high-resolution imaging observations of the SZ intensity maps at these
  frequencies, obtainable with the LABOCA and HERSCHEL-SPIRE instruments, allow to
  fully exploit the astrophysical relevance of the predicted SZ morphological effect.
