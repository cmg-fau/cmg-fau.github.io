abstract: The spectacular images of the M 87 black hole taken by the Event Horizon
  Telescope (EHT) have opened a new era of black hole research. One of the next issues
  is to take polarization images around the central black hole (BH). Since radio emission
  is produced by synchrotron process, polarization properties should vividly reflect
  the magnetic field structures at the jet base and thus provide good information
  regarding the magnetic mechanism of jet formation. With this kept in mind we perform
  general relativistic (GR) radiative transfer calculations of polarized light based
  on the GR magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation data of accretion flow and outflow
  in M 87, to obtain their linear and circular polarization images in the BH horizon-scale.
  We found that the linear polarization components originating from the jet base and
  inner accretion flow should experience Faraday rotation and depolarization when
  passing through magnetized plasmas around the BH, thus sensitively depending on
  the BH spin. Through the comparison with total intensity image at $1.3\:$ mm by
  EHT and the polarization degree and the rotation measure (RM) measured at $1.3\:$
  mm with the Submillimeter Array, the model with the spin parameter of $a=0.9\, M_\,\mathrmBH$
  (with $M_\,\mathrmBH$ being the BH mass) is favored over other models with $a =
  0.5\, M_\,\mathrmBH$ or $0.99\, M_\,\mathrmBH$ , though we need further systematic
  studies for confirmation. We also find in low- temperature models a clear ring-like
  image in the circular polarization map, which arises because of Faraday conversion
  of the linearly polarized synchrotron emission and is thus indicative of magnetic
  field direction. This occurs only when the emission region is threaded with well-ordered
  magnetic fields and hence no clear images are expected in high- temperature disk
  models, in which disk emission is appreciable. We will be able to elucidate the
  field configuration through the comparison between the simulated polarization images
  and future polarimetry with EHT and other VLBI observations.
