abstract: We present the SILVERRUSH program strategy and clustering properties investigated
  with ̃2000 Ly\ensuremathα emitters (LAEs) at z = 5.7 and 6.6 found in the early
  data of the Hyper Suprime- Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program survey exploiting
  the carefully designed narrow-band filters. We derive angular correlation functions
  with the unprecedentedly large samples of LAEs at z = 6-7 over the large total area
  of 14-21 deg$^2$ corresponding to 0.3-0.5 comoving Gpc$^2$. We obtain the average
  large-scale bias values of b$_avg$ = 4.1 \ensuremath± 0.2 (4.5 \ensuremath± 0.6)
  at z = 5.7 (z = 6.6) for \ensuremath\gtrsim L* LAEs, indicating a weak evolution
  of LAE clustering from z = 5.7 to 6.6. We compare the LAE clustering results with
  two independent theoretical models that suggest an increase of an LAE clustering
  signal by the patchy ionized bubbles at the epoch of reionization (EoR), and estimate
  the neutral hydrogen fraction to be x_\H I\=0.15\̂+0.15\_\-0.15\ at z = 6.6. Based
  on the halo occupation distribution models, we find that the \ensuremath\gtrsim
  L* LAEs are hosted by dark-matter halos with an average mass of log (&lt; M_h &gt;
  /M_☉ ) =11.1\+̂0.2\_\-0.4\ (10.8\^0̂.3\_\-0.5\) at z = 5.7 (6.6) with a Ly\ensuremathα
  duty cycle of 1% or less, where the results of z = 6.6 LAEs may be slightly biased,
  due to the increase of the clustering signal at the EoR. Our clustering analysis
  reveals the low-mass nature of \ensuremath\gtrsim L* LAEs at z = 6-7, and that these
  LAEs probably evolve into massive super-L* galaxies in the present-day universe.
