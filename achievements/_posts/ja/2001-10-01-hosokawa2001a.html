abstract: 'The cosmological evolution of the QSO luminosity functions (LFs) at NIR/optical/X-ray
  bands for 1.3 &lt;åisebox-0.5ex~ z &lt;\i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 3.5 is discussed based on
  realistic QSO spectra. The accretion-disk theory predicts that although the QSO
  luminosities only depend on the mass-accretion rate, dot\M\, the QSO spectra have
  dependence on the black- hole mass, M$_BH$, as well. The smaller is M$_BH$ and/or
  the larger is dot\M\, the harder does the QSO NIR/optical/UV spectrum become. We
  modeled the disk spectra which can reproduce these features, and calculated the
  LFs for a redshift of z \rs̊ebox-0.5ex~ 3 with the assumption of new- born QSOs
  shining at the Eddington luminosity. The main results are: (i) the LFs observed
  at optical and X-ray bands can be simultaneously reproduced. (ii) LFs in the optical
  and X-ray bands are not sensitive to M$_BH$, while LFs at the NIR bands are; about
  a one order of magnitude difference is expected in the volume number densities at
  L$_I,J$ \rae̊box-0.5ex~ 10$^46$ erg s$^-1$ between the case that all QSOs would
  have the same spectral shape as that of M$_BH$ = 10$^9$Msolar and the case with
  M$_BH$ = 10$^11$ Msolar. (iii) The resultant LFs at NIR are dominated by black holes
  at L$_I,J$ &lt;\raib̊ox-0.5ex~ 10$^44$ erg s$^-1$, and by 10$^11$Msolar black holes
  at L$_I,J$ &gt;\raiso̊x-0.5ex~ 10$^46$ erg s$^-1$. Future infrared observations
  from space (e.g. NGST) will probe the cosmological evolution of black-hole masses.
  For a redshift of z &lt; 3, on the other hand, the observed optical/X-ray LFs can
  be fitted if the initial QSO luminosity, L$_0$, is below the Eddington luminosity,
  L$_Edd$. Interestingly, the best- fitted values of l \ensuremath≡ L$_0$/L$_Edd$
  are different in the B- and X-ray bands; l$_B$ \ensuremath≈ 2.5 l$_x$. The reason
  for this discrepancy is briefly discussed.'
