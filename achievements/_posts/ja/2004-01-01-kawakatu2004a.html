abstract: A potential mechanism is proposed to account for the fact that supermassive
  black holes (SMBHs) in disk galaxies appear to be smaller than those in elliptigalaxies
  in the same luminosity range. We consider the formation of SMBHs by radiation drag
  (the Poynting-Robertson effect), which extracts angular momentum from interstellar
  matter and thereby drives the mass accretion onto a galactic center. In particular,
  we quantitatively scrutinize the efficiency of radiation drag in a galaxy composed
  of bulge and disk, and we elucidate the relation between the final mass of SMBH
  and the bulge-to-disk ratio of the galaxy. As a result, it is found that the BH-to-galaxy
  mass ratio, M$_BH$/M$_galaxy$, decreases with a smaller bulge-to-disk ratio, because
  of the effects of geometridilution and opacity, and is reduced maximally by 2 orders
  of magnitude, resulting in M$_BH$/M$_galaxy$åisebox-0.5ex~10$^-5$. In contrast,
  if only the bulge components in galaxies are focused, the BH-to-bulge mass ratio
  becomes M$_BH$/M$_bulge$\i̊sebox-0.5ex~10$^-3$, which is similar to that found in
  elliptigalaxies. Thus, it turns out that the mass of an SMBH primarily correlates
  with a bulge, not with a disk, consistent with observational data.
