abstract: 'We study fundamental properties of steady, spherically symmetric, isothermal
  galactic outflows in appropriate gravitational potential models. We aim at constructing
  a universal scale-free theory not only for galactic winds, but also for winds from
  clusters/groups of galaxies. In particular, we consider effects of mass-density
  distribution on the formation of transonic galactic outflows under several models
  of the density distribution profile predicted by cosmological simulations of structure
  formation based on the cold dark matter (CDM) scenario. In this study, we have clarified
  that there exist two types of transonic solutions: outflows from the central region
  and from a distant region with a finite radius, depending upon the density distribution
  of the system. The system with a sufficiently steep density gradient at the centre
  is allowed to have the transonic outflows from the centre. The resultant criterion
  intriguingly indicates that the density gradient at the centre must be steeper than
  the prediction of conventional CDM models including Navarro, Frenk &amp; White and
  Moore et al. This result suggests that an additional steeper density distribution
  originated by baryonic systems such as the stellar component and/or the central
  massive black hole is required to realize transonic outflows from the central region.
  On the other hand, we predict the outflow, which is started at the outskirts of
  the galactic centre and is slowly accelerated without any drastic energy injection
  like starburst events. These transonic outflows may contribute secularly to the
  metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium.'
