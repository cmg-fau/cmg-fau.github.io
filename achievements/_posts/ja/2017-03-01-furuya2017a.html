abstract: We investigate the delivery of regular and deuterated forms of water from
  prestellar cores to circumstellar disks. We adopt a semi- analytical, axisymmetric,
  two-dimensional collapsing core model with post-processing gas-ice astrochemical
  simulations, in which a layered ice structure is considered. The physical and chemical
  evolutions are followed until the end of the main accretion phase. In our models,
  when mass averaged over the whole disk, a forming disk has a similar H$_2$O abundance
  and HDO/H$_2$O abundance ratio (within a factor of 2) as the precollapse values
  of these quantities, regardless of time. Consistent with previous studies, our models
  suggest that interstellar water ice is delivered to forming disks without significant
  alteration. On the other hand, the local vertically averaged H$_2$O ice abundance
  and HDO/H$_2$O ice ratio can differ more, by up to a factor of several, depending
  on time and distance from a central star. Key parameters for the local variations
  are the fluence of stellar UV photons en route into the disk and the ice layered
  structure, the latter of which is mostly established in the prestellar stages. We
  also find that even if interstellar water ice is destroyed by stellar UV and (partly)
  reformed prior to disk entry, the HDO/H$_2$O ratio in reformed water ice is similar
  to the original value. This finding indicates that some caution is needed in discussions
  on the prestellar inheritance of H$_2$O based on comparisons between the observationally
  derived HDO/H$_2$O ratio in clouds/cores and that in disks/comets. Alternatively,
  we propose that the ratio of D$_2$O/HDO to HDO/H$_2$O better probes the prestellar
  inheritance of H$_2$O. It is also found that in forming disks icy organics are more
  enriched in deuterium than water ice. The differential deuterium fractionation in
  water and organics is inherited from prestellar stages.
