abstract: We present four radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies with extreme
  emission-line shifts, indicating radial outflow velocities of the ionized gas of
  up to 2450 km s$^-1$, above the escape velocity of the host galaxies. The forbidden
  lines show strong broadening, up to 2270 km s$^-1$. An ionization stratification
  (higher line shift at higher ionization potential) implies that we see a large-scale
  outflow rather than single, localized jet-cloud interactions. Similarly, the paucity
  of zero-velocity [O III] \ensuremath≈Çambda5007 emitting gas implies the absence
  of a second narrow-line region (NLR) component at rest, and therefore a large part
  of the high- ionization NLR is affected by the outflow. Given the radio loudness
  of these NLS1 galaxies, the observations are consistent with a pole on view onto
  their central engines, so that the effects of polar outflows are maximized. In addition,
  a very efficient driving mechanism is required to reach the high observed velocities.
  We explore implications from recent hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction
  between fast winds or jets with the large-scale NLR. Overall, the best agreement
  with observations (and especially the high outflow speeds of the [Ne V] emitting
  gas) can be reached if the NLS1 galaxies are relatively young sources with lifetimes
  not much exceeding 1 Myr. These systems represent sites of strong feedback at NLR
  scales at work, well below redshift one. <P />
