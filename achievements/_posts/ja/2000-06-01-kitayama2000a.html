abstract: To explain the effects of the ultraviolet (UV) background radiation on the
  collapse of pre-galactic clouds, we implement a radiation- hydrodynamical calculation,
  combining one-dimensional spherical hydrodynamics with an accurate treatment of
  the radiative transfer of ionizing photons. Both absorption and scattering of UV
  photons are explicitly taken into account. It turns out that a gas cloud contracting
  within the dark matter potential does not settle into hydrostatic equilibrium, but
  undergoes run-away collapse even under the presence of the external UV field. The
  cloud centre is shown to become self-shielded against ionizing photons by radiative
  transfer effects before shrinking to the rotation barrier. Based on our simulation
  results, we further discuss the possibility of H$_2$ cooling and subsequent star
  formation in a run-away collapsing core. The present results are closely relevant
  to the survival of subgalactic Population III objects as well as to metal injection
  into intergalactic space.
