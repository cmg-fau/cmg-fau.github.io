abstract: We performed a series of high-resolution N-body simulations to examine whether
  dark matter candidates in the form of primordial black holes (PBHs) can solve the
  cusp-core problem in low-mass dwarf galaxies. If some fraction of the dark matter
  in low-mass dwarf galaxies consists of PBHs and the rest is cold dark matter, dynamical
  heating of the cold dark matter by the PBHs induces a cusp-to-core transition in
  the total dark matter profile. The mechanism works for PBHs in the 25-100 M$_â˜‰$
  mass window, consistent with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory
  (LIGO) detections, but requires a lower limit on the PBH mass fraction of 1 per
  cent of the total dwarf galaxy dark matter content. The cusp-to-core transition
  time-scale is between 1 and 8 Gyr. This time-scale is also a constant multiple of
  the relaxation time between cold dark matter particles and PBHs, which depends on
  the mass, the mass fraction, and the scale radius of the initial density profile
  of PBHs. We conclude that dark matter cores occur naturally in haloes composed of
  cold dark matter and PBHs, without the need to invoke baryonic processes.
