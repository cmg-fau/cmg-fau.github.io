abstract: The pancake collapse of pregalactic clouds under UV background radiation
  is explored with a one-dimensional sheet model. Here, attention is concentrated
  on elucidating the basic physics on the thermal evolution of pregalactic clouds
  exposed to diffuse UV radiation. So, we treat accurately the radiation transfer
  for the ionizing photons, with solving chemical reactions regarding hydrogen molecules
  as well as atoms. The self-shielding against UV radiation by H$_2$ Lyman-Werner
  bands, which regulates the photodissociation of hydrogen molecules, is also taken
  into account. As a result, it is found that when the UV background radiation is
  at a level of 10$^-22$(\ensuremathν/\ensuremathν$_L$)$^-1$ ergs s$^-1$ cm$^-2$ Hz$^-1$
  sr$^-1$, the cloud evolution bifurcates with a critical mass as M$_SB$=2.2×10$^11$
  M$_solar$[(1+z$_c$)/5]$^-4.2$, where z$_c$ is the final collapse epoch. A cloud
  more massive than M$_SB$ cools below 5×10$^3$ K owing to H$_2$ line emission at
  the pancake collapse and would undergo the initial starburst. The pancake possibly
  evolves into a virialized system in a dissipationless fashion. Consequently, this
  leads to the dissipationless galaxy formation at 3&lt;åisebox-0.5ex\text asciitildez$_c$&lt;\i̊sebox-0.5ex~10.
  A cloud less massive than M$_SB$ cannot cool by H$_2$ emission shortly after the
  pancake collapse but could cool in the course of shrinking to the rotation barrier.
  This is likely to lead to the dissipational galaxy formation at relatively low redshifts
  as 0&lt;\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~z$_c$&lt;\rae̊box- 0.5ex~4. The present results provide a
  solid physical mechanism that controls the star formation efficiency in the pregalactic
  clouds. In the context of a standard CDM cosmology, M$_SB$ lies between 1 \ensuremathσ
  and 2 \ensuremathσ density fluctuations.
