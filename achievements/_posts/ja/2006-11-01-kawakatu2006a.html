abstract: The formation and growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) physically
  linked with bulges are considered. We focus on the radiation hydrodynamic process
  for the growth of SMBH in the optically thick starburst phase, where radiation from
  bulge stars drives the mass accretion on to a galactic center through radiation
  drag effect. In the present scenario, the AGN luminosity- dominant phase (QSO phase)
  is preceded by the host luminosity- dominant phase, which is called ``proto-QSO
  phase''. Comparing with observations, we found that the ultraluminous infrared galaxies
  that contain a type I Seyfert nucleus (a type I ULIRG) are the early phase of BH
  growth, namely correspond to the proto-QSO phase.
