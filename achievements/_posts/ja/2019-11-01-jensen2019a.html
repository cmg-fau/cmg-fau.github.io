abstract: 'Context. How water is delivered to planetary systems is a central question
  in astrochemistry. The deuterium fractionation of water can serve as a tracer for
  the chemical and physical evolution of water during star formation and can constrain
  the origin of water in Solar System bodies. <BR /> Aims: The aim is to determine
  the HDO/H$_2$O ratio in the inner warm gas toward three low-mass Class 0 protostars
  selected to be in isolated cores, i.e., not associated with any cloud complexes.
  Previous sources for which the HDO/H$_2$O ratio have been established were all part
  of larger star-forming complexes. Determining the HDO/H$_2$O ratio toward three
  isolated protostars allows comparison of the water chemistry in isolated and clustered
  regions to determine the influence of local cloud environment. <BR /> Methods: We
  present ALMA Band 6 observations of the HDO 3$_1,2$-2$_2,1$ and 2$_1,1$-2$_1,2$
  transitions at 225.897 GHz and 241.562 GHz along with the first ALMA Band 5 observations
  of the H$_2$$^18$O 3$_1,3$-2$_2,0$ transition at 203.407 GHz. The high angular resolution
  observations (0``.3-1''''.3) allow the study of the inner warm envelope gas. Model-independent
  estimates for the HDO/H$_2$O ratios are obtained and compared with previous determinations
  of the HDO/H$_2$O ratio in the warm gas toward low-mass protostars. <BR /> Results:
  We successfully detect the targeted water transitions toward the three sources with
  signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) &gt; 5. We determine the HDO/H$_2$O ratio toward L483,
  B335 and BHR71-IRS1 to be (2.2 \ensuremath± 0.4) × 10$^-3$, (1.7 \ensuremath± 0.3)
  × 10$^-3$, and (1.8 \ensuremath± 0.4) × 10$^-3$, respectively, assuming T$_ex$ =
  124 K. The degree of water deuteration of these isolated protostars are a factor
  of 2-4 higher relative to Class 0 protostars that are members of known nearby clustered
  star-forming regions. <BR /> Conclusions: The results indicate that the water deuterium
  fractionation is influenced by the local cloud environment. This effect can be explained
  by variations in either collapse timescales or temperatures, which depends on local
  cloud dynamics and could provide a new method to decipher the history of young stars.'
