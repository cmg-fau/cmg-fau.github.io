abstract: Blueshifted absorption lines are seen in high inclination black hole binary
  systems in their disc-dominated states, showing these power an equatorial disc wind.
  While some contribution from magnetic winds remain a possibility, thermal and thermal-
  radiative winds are expected to be present. We show results from radiation hydrodynamic
  simulations that show that the additional radiation force from atomic features (bound-free
  and lines) is important along with electron scattering. Together, these increase
  the wind velocity at high inclinations, so that they quantitatively match the observations
  in H1743-322, unlike purely thermal winds that are too slow. We highlight the role
  played by shadowing of the outer disc from the (subgrid) inner disc Compton heated
  layer, and show that the increase in shadow from the higher Compton temperature
  after the spectral transition to the hard state leads to strong suppression of the
  wind. Thermal-radiative winds explain all of the spectral features (and their disappearance)
  in this simplest wind system and magnetic winds play only a minor role. We speculate
  that thermal-radiative winds can explain all the spectral features seen in the more
  complex (larger disc size) binaries, GRO J1655-40 and GRS 1915+105, without requiring
  magnetic winds.
