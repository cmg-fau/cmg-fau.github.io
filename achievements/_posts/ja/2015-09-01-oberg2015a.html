abstract: In a protoplanetary disk, a combination of thermal and non-thermal desorption
  processes regulate where volatiles are liberated from icy grain mantles into the
  gas phase. Non-thermal desorption should result in volatile-enriched gas in disk-regions
  where complete freeze-out is otherwise expected. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter
  Array observations of the disk around the young star IM Lup in 1.4 mm continuum,
  C$^18$O 2-1, H$^13$CO$^+$ 3-2 and DCO$^+$ 3-2 emission at ̃0.″5 resolution. The
  images of these dust and gas tracers are clearly resolved. The DCO$^+$ line exhibits
  a striking pair of concentric rings of emission that peak at radii of ̃0.″6 and
  2″ (̃90 and 300 AU, respectively). Based on disk chemistry model comparison, the
  inner DCO$^+$ ring is associated with the balance of CO freeze-out and thermal desorption
  due to a radial decrease in disk temperature. The outer DCO$^+$ ring is explained
  by non-thermal desorption of CO ice in the low-column- density outer disk, repopulating
  the disk midplane with cold CO gas. The CO gas then reacts with abundant H$_2$D$^+$
  to form the observed DCO$^+$ outer ring. These observations demonstrate that spatially
  resolved DCO$^+$ emission can be used to trace otherwise hidden cold gas reservoirs
  in the outmost disk regions, opening a new window onto their chemistry and kinematics.
