abstract: To elucidate the permeation of cosmic ultraviolet (UV) background radiation
  into a pregalactic cloud and the subsequent ionization, the frequency-dependent
  radiative transfer equation is solved, coupled with the ionization process, for
  a spherical top-hat cloud composed of pure hydrogen. The calculations properly involve
  scattering processes of ionizing photons that originate from radiative recombination.
  As a result, it is shown that the self-shielding, although it is often disregarded
  in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, could start to emerge shortly after the
  maximum expansion stages of density fluctuations. Quantitatively, the self-shielding
  is prominent above a critical number density of hydrogen, which is given by n$_crit$
  = 1.4 × 10$^-2$ cm$^-3$ (M/10$^8$ M$_solar$)$^-1/5$I$^3/5$$_21$ for 10$^4$ K gas,
  where M is the cloud mass and the UV background intensity is assumed to be I$_\ensuremathν$
  = 10$^-21$I$_21$(\en suremathν/\ensuremathν$_L$)$^-1$ ergs cm$^-2$ s$^-1$ sr$^-1$
  Hz$^-1$, with \ensuremathν$_L$ being the Lyman limit frequency. The weak dependence
  of n$_crit$ upon the mass is worth noting. The corresponding critical optical depth
  (\ensuremathτ$_crit$) turns out to be independent of either M or I$_21$, which is
  \ensuremathτ$_crit$ = 2.4 for 10$^4$ K gas. The present analysis reveals that the
  Strömgren approximation leads to overestimation of the photoionization effects.
  Also, the self-shielded neutral core is no longer sharply separated from surrounding
  ionized regions; a low but noticeable degree of ionization is caused by high-energy
  photons even in the self- shielded core. The present results may be substantial
  when one considers the biasing by photoionization against low-mass galaxy formation.
