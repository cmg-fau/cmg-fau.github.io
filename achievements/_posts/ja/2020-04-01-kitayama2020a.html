abstract: We present measurements of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) toward
  SPT-CL J2334-4243 (the Phoenix galaxy cluster) at $z=0.597$ by the Atacama Large
  Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Band 3. The SZE is imaged at $5^\prime
  \prime $ resolution (corresponding to the physical scale of $23\:h^-1\:$ kpc) within
  $200\:h^-1\:$ kpc from the central galaxy, with the peak signal-to-noise ratio exceeding
  11. Combined with the Chandra X-ray image, the ALMA SZE data further allow for non-parametric
  deprojection of electron temperature, density, and entropy. Our method can minimize
  contamination by the central active galactic nucleus and the X-ray absorbing gas
  within the cluster, both of which greatly affect the X-ray spectrum. We find no
  significant asymmetry or disturbance in the SZE image within the current measurement
  errors. The detected SZE signal shows much higher central concentration than other
  distant galaxy clusters and agrees well with the average pressure profile of local
  cool-core clusters. Unlike in typical clusters at any redshift, the gas temperature
  drops by at least a factor of 5 toward the center. We identify $∼\!\! 6 \times 10^11\,
  M_ødot$ cool gas with temperature $∼\!\! 3\:$ keV in the inner $20\:h^-1\:$ kpc.
  Taken together, our results imply that the gas is indeed cooling efficiently and
  nearly isobarically down to this radius in the Phoenix cluster.
