abstract: 'We present a novel scenario for globular cluster (GC) formation, where
  the ultraviolet (UV) background radiation effectively works so as to produce compact
  star clusters. Recent observations on the age distributions of GCs indicate that
  many GCs formed even after the cosmic reionization epoch. This implies that a significant
  fraction of GCs formed in UV background radiation fields. Also, the star formation
  in an early-generation of subgalactic objects may be affected by strong UV radiation
  from pre-formed massive stars, e.g. Population III stars. Here, we explore the formation
  of GCs in UV radiation fields. For this purpose, we calculate baryon and dark matter
  (DM) dynamics in spherical symmetry, incorporating the self-shielding effects by
  solving the radiative transfer of UV radiation. In addition, we prescribe the star
  formation in cooled gas components and pursue the dynamics of formed stars. As a
  result, we find that the evolution of subgalactic objects in UV background radiation
  is separated into three types: (i) prompt star formation, where less massive clouds
  (åisebox-0.5ex~10$^5-8$M$_solar$) are promptly self-shielded and undergo star formation,
  (ii) delayed star formation, where photoionized massive clouds (&gt;\i̊sebox-0.5ex~10$^8$M$_solar$)
  collapse despite high thermal pressure and are eventually self- shielded to form
  stars in a delayed fashion, and (iii) supersonic infall, where photoionized less
  massive clouds (\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~10$^5-8$M$_solar$) contract with supersonic infall
  velocity and are self-shielded when a compact core forms. In particular, the type
  (iii) is a novel type found in the present simulations, and eventually produces
  a very compact star cluster. The resultant mass-to-light ratios, half-mass radii
  and velocity dispersions for the three types are compared to the observations of
  GCs, dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) and ultracompact dwarfs (UCDs). It turns out that
  the properties of star clusters resulting from supersonic infall match well with
  those of observed GCs, whereas the other two types are distinct from GCs. Hence,
  we conclude that supersonic infall in a UV background is a promising mechanism to
  form GCs.'
