abstract: We explore the impact of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from massive Population
  III (Pop III) stars of 25, 40, 80 and 120M$_solar$ on the subsequent Pop III star
  formation. In this paper, particular attention is paid to the dependence of radiative
  feedback on the mass of source Pop III star. UV radiation from the source star can
  work to impede the secondary star formation through the photoheating and photodissociation
  processes. Recently, Susa and Umemura have shown that the ionizing radiation alleviates
  the negative effect by H$_2$-dissociating radiation from 120M$_solar$ Pop III star,
  since an H$_2$ shell formed ahead of an ionizing front can effectively shield H$_2$-dissociating
  radiation. On the other hand, it is expected that the negative feedback by H$_2$-dissociating
  radiation can be predominant if a source star is less massive, since a ratio of
  the H$_2$-dissociating photon number to the ionizing photon number becomes higher.
  In order to investigate the radiative feedback effects from such less massive stars,
  we perform three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations, incorporating the
  radiative transfer effect of ionizing and H$_2$-dissociating radiation. As a result,
  we find that if a source star is less massive than Ã¥isebox-0.5ex~25M$_solar$, the
  ionizing radiation cannot suppress the negative feedback of H$_2$-dissociating radiation.
  Therefore, the fate of the neighbouring clouds around such less massive stars is
  determined solely by the flux of H$_2$-dissociating radiation from source stars.
  By making analytic estimates of H$_2$ shell formation and its shielding effect,
  we derive the criteria for radiation hydrodynamic feedback depending on the source
  star mass.
