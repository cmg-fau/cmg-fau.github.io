abstract: We have initiated a new survey for local extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPGs)
  with Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) large-area (\ensuremath∼500 deg$^2$) optical
  images reaching a 5\ensuremathσ limit of \ensuremath∼26 mag, about 100 times deeper
  than the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). To select Z/Z$_\ensuremathødot$ $łt$ 0.1
  EMPGs from \ensuremath∼40 million sources detected in the Subaru images, we first
  develop a machine-learning (ML) classifier based on a deep neural network algorithm
  with a training data set consisting of optical photometry of galaxy, star, and QSO
  models. We test our ML classifier with SDSS objects having spectroscopic metallicity
  measurements and confirm that our ML classifier accomplishes 86% completeness and
  46% purity EMPG classifications with photometric data. Applying our ML classifier
  to the photometric data of the Subaru sources, as well as faint SDSS objects with
  no spectroscopic data, we obtain 27 and 86 EMPG candidates from the Subaru and SDSS
  photometric data, respectively. We conduct optical follow-up spectroscopy for 10
  of our EMPG candidates with Magellan/LDSS-3+MagE, Keck/DEIMOS, and Subaru/FOCAS
  and find that the 10 EMPG candidates are star-forming galaxies at z = 0.007-0.03
  with large H\ensuremathβ equivalent widths of 104-265 ̊A, stellar masses of log(
  $M_⋆ $ / $M_ødot $ ) = 5.0-7.1, and high specific star formation rates of \ensuremath∼300
  Gyr$^-1$, which are similar to those of early galaxies at z \ensuremath\gtrsim 6
  reported recently. We spectroscopically confirm that 3 out of 10 candidates are
  truly EMPGs with Z/Z$_\ensuremathødot$ $łt$ 0.1, one of which is HSC J1631+4426,
  the most metal-poor galaxy, with Z/Z$_\ensuremathødot$ = 0.016, ever reported. $^*$
  Partly based on data obtained with the Subaru Telescope. The Subaru Telescope is
  operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. † The data presented
  herein were partly obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as
  a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University
  of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory
  was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.
  †dbl This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located
  at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.
