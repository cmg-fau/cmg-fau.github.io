abstract: We investigated the correlation between nuclear/circumnuclear starbursts
  around active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and the AGN activities for 43 Seyfert galaxies
  in the CfA and 12 \ensuremathÎ¼m samples. We found that the circumnuclear starburst
  luminosity, as well as the nuclear starburst luminosity, is positively correlated
  with the AGN luminosity. Moreover, the nuclear starburst luminosity is more strongly
  correlated with the AGN luminosity normalized with the AGN Eddington luminosity
  than is the circumnuclear starburst luminosity. This implies that starbursts nearer
  the AGN could have a greater effect on AGN mass accretion. We also discuss these
  results from the viewpoint of the radiation effects from starbursts and sequential
  starbursts.
