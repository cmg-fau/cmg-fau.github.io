abstract: We present a new numerical scheme to solve the transfer of diffuse radiation
  on three-dimensional mesh grids which is efficient on processors with highly parallel
  architecture such as recently popular GPUs and CPUs with multi- and many-core architectures.
  The scheme is based on the ray-tracing method and the computational cost is proportional
  to N_m\Ì‚ 5/3\, where N$_m$ is the number of mesh grids, and is devised to compute
  the radiation transfer along each light-ray completely in parallel, with appropriate
  grouping of the light-rays. We find that the performance of our scheme scales well
  with the number of adopted CPU cores and GPUs, and also that our scheme is nicely
  parallelized on a multi-node system by adopting the multiple wave front scheme,
  and the performance scales well with the amount of computational resources. As numerical
  tests to validate our scheme and to give a physical criterion for the angular resolution
  of our ray-tracing scheme, we perform several numerical simulations of the photoionization
  of neutral hydrogen gas by ionizing radiation sources without the ``on-the-spot''
  approximation, in which the transfer of diffuse radiation by radiative recombination
  is incorporated in a self-consistent manner. <P />
