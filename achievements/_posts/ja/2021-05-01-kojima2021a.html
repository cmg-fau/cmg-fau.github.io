<p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >We present element abundance ratios and ionizing radiation of local young low-mass (<span 
class="txsy-">~</span>10<sup><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">6</span></sup>
M<sub><span 
class="txsy-x-x-74">⊙</span></sub>) extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPGs) with a 2% solar oxygen abundance (O/H)<sub><span 
class="txsy-x-x-74">⊙</span></sub> and
a high specific star formation rate (sSFR <span 
class="txsy-">~ </span>300 Gyr<sup><span 
class="txsy-x-x-74">-</span><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">1</span></sup>) and other (extremely) metal-poor
galaxies, which are compiled from Extremely Metal-Poor Representatives Explored by
the Subaru Survey (EMPRESS) and the literature. Weak emission lines such as
[Fe III] <span 
class="txmi-">λ</span>4658 and He II <span 
class="txmi-">λ</span>4686 are detected in very deep optical spectra of the
EMPGs taken with 8 m class telescopes, including Keck and Subaru, enabling
us to derive element abundance ratios with photoionization models. We find that
neon-to-oxygen and argon-to-oxygen ratios are comparable to those of known local dwarf
galaxies and that the nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios (N/O) are lower than
20% (N/O)<sub><span 
class="txsy-x-x-74">⊙</span></sub>, consistent with the low oxygen abundance. However, the iron-to-
oxygen abundance ratios (Fe/O) of the EMPGs are generally high; the EMPGs with
the 2%-solar oxygen abundance show high Fe/O ratios of <span 
class="txsy-">~</span>90%-140% (Fe/O)<sub><span 
class="txsy-x-x-74">⊙</span></sub>,
which are unlikely to be explained by suggested scenarios of Type Ia supernova
iron productions, iron&#8217;s dust depletion, and metal-poor gas inflow onto previously
metal-riched galaxies with solar abundances. Moreover, the EMPGs with the 2%-solar
oxygen abundance have very high He II <span 
class="txmi-">λ</span>4686/H<span 
class="txmi-">β </span>ratios of <span 
class="txsy-">~</span>1/40, which are not
reproduced by existing models of high-mass X-ray binaries with progenitor stellar
masses <120 M<sub><span 
class="txsy-x-x-74">⊙</span></sub>. Comparing stellar-nucleosynthesis and photoionization models
with a comprehensive sample of EMPGs identified by this and previous EMPG
studies, we propose that both the high Fe/O ratios and the high He II <span 
class="txmi-">λ</span>4686/H<span 
class="txmi-">β</span>
ratios are explained by the past existence of supermassive (>300 M<sub><span 
class="txsy-x-x-74">⊙</span></sub>) stars, which
may evolve into intermediate-mass black holes (<span 
class="txsya-">≳</span>100 M<sub><span 
class="txsy-x-x-74">⊙</span></sub>). <sup><span 
class="txsy-x-x-74">*</span></sup> Partly based on data
obtained with the Subaru Telescope. The Subaru Telescope is operated by the National
Astronomical Observatory of Japan. <sup></sup> The data presented herein were partly obtained at the
W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the
California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the
generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation. <sup></sup> This paper includes data
gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory,
