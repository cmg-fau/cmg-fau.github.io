<p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >UltraFast Outflows (UFOs) are observed in some active galactic nuclei (AGN), with
blueshifted and highly ionized Fe-K absorption features. AGN typically have an ultraviolet
(UV-) bright accretion flow, so UV line driving is an obvious candidate for launching these
winds. However this mechanism requires material with UV opacity, in apparent conflict with
the observed high- ionization state of the wind. In this paper, we synthesize the X-ray energy
spectra resulting from different lines of sight through a state of the art radiation
hydrodynamics UV line- driven disc wind simulation. We demonstrate that there are some
lines of sight that only intercept highly ionized and fast outflowing material. The cooler
material required for the UV line driving acceleration is out of the line of sight,
close to the disc, shielded from the X-rays by a failed wind. We fit these simulated
wind spectra to data from the archetypal UFO source PG 1211+143 and show that
they broadly reproduce the depth and velocity of the iron absorption lines seen.
This directly demonstrates that UV line driving is a viable mechanism to launch
even the fastest UFOs. We simulate microcalorimeter observations of this wind
and show that their high-energy resolution can resolve the detailed structure in the
wind and recover the wind energetics when combined with models that correctly
estimate the line formation radius of the wind. New data from microcalorimeters
will pave the way for physical predictions of AGN wind feedback in cosmological
simulations.</p>
