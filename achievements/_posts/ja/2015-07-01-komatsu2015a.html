abstract: For detecting life from reflection spectra on extrasolar planets, trace
  of photosynthesis is one of the indicators. However, it is not yet clear what kind
  of radiation environments is acceptable for photosynthesis. Light absorption in
  photosystems on the Earth occurs using limited photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophylls
  (Chls) and bacteriochlorophylls (BChls). Efficiencies of light absorption for the
  pigments were evaluated by calculating the specific molecular absorption spectra
  at the high accuracy-quantum mechanical level. We used realistic stellar radiation
  spectra such as F, G, K and M-type stars to investigate the efficiencies. We found
  that the efficiencies are increased with the temperature of stars, from M to F star.
  Photosynthetic pigments have two types of absorption bands, the Q $_ y $ and Soret.
  In higher temperature stars like F star, contributions from the Soret region of
  the pigments are dominant for the efficiency. On the other hand, in lower temperature
  stars like M stars, the Q $_ y $ band is crucial. Therefore, differences on the
  absorption intensity and the wavelength between the Q $_ y $ and Soret band are
  the most important to characterize the photosynthetic pigments. Among photosynthetic
  pigments, Chls tend to be efficient in higher temperature stars, while BChls are
  efficient for M stars. Blueward of the 4000 ÌŠA break, the efficiencies of BChls
  are smaller than Chls in the higher temperature stars. <P />
