abstract: In the past several decades, the standard cosmological model has been established
  and its parameters have been measured to a high precision, while there are still
  many fundamental questions in cosmology; such as the physics in the very early universe,
  the origin of the cosmic acceleration, and the nature of dark matter. The forthcoming
  radio telescope, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), which will be the world's largest,
  will be able to open a new frontier in cosmology and will be one of the most powerful
  tools for cosmology in the coming decade. The cosmological surveys conducted by
  the SKA would have the potential not only to answer these fundamental questions
  but also deliver precision cosmology. In this article we briefly review the role
  of the SKA from the viewpoint of modern cosmology. The cosmological science led
  by the SKA-Japan Consortium (SKA-JP) Cosmology Science Working Group is also discussed.
