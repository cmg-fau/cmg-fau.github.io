abstract: Recent observations suggest that dense gas clouds can survive even in hot
  galactic winds. Here we show that the inclusion of turbulent densities with different
  statistical properties has significant effects on the evolution of wind-swept clouds.
  We investigate how the initial standard deviation of the lognormal density field
  influences the dynamics of quasi-isothermal clouds embedded in supersonic winds.
  We compare uniform, fractal solenoidal, and fractal compressive cloud models in
  both 3D and 2D hydrodynamical simulations. We find that the processes of cloud disruption
  and dense gas entrainment are functions of the initial density distribution in the
  cloud. Fractal clouds accelerate, mix, and are disrupted earlier than uniform clouds.
  Within the fractal cloud sample, compressive clouds retain high- density nuclei,
  so they are more confined, less accelerated, and have lower velocity dispersions
  than their solenoidal counterparts. Compressive clouds are also less prone to Kelvin-
  Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, so they survive longer than solenoidal
  clouds. By comparing the cloud properties at the destruction time, we find that
  dense gas entrainment is more effective in uniform clouds than in either of the
  fractal clouds, and it is more effective in solenoidal than in compressive models.
  In contrast, mass loading into the wind is more efficient in compressive cloud models
  than in uniform or solenoidal models. Overall, wide density distributions lead to
  inefficient entrainment, but they facilitate mass loading and favour the survival
  of very dense gas in hot galactic winds.
