abstract: 'We present the results of structure analyses for a large sample of 426
  Ly\ensuremathα emitters (LAEs) at z åisebox-0.5ex~ 2.2 that are observed with the
  Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys and WFC3-IR during deep extra-galactic
  legacy surveys. We confirm that the merger fraction and the average ellipticity
  of LAE''s stellar component are 10%-30% and 0.4-0.6, respectively, that are comparable
  with previous study results. We successfully identify that some LAEs have a spatial
  offset between Ly\ensuremathα and stellar-continuum emission peaks, \ensuremathδ$_Ly\ensuremathα$,
  by \i̊sebox-0.5ex~2.5-4 kpc beyond our statistical errors. To uncover the physical
  origin of strong Ly\ensuremathα emission found in LAEs, we investigate the Ly\ensuremathα
  equivalent width (EW) dependences of three structural parameters: merger fraction,
  \ensuremathδ$_Ly\ensuremathα$, and ellipticity of stellar distribution in the range
  of EW(Ly\ensuremathα) = 20-250 \r̊. Contrary to expectations, we find that the merger
  fraction does not significantly increase with Ly\ensuremathα EW. We reveal an anti-correlation
  between \ensuremathδ$_Ly\ensuremathα$ and EW(Ly\ensuremathα) using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov
  (K-S) test. There is a trend that the LAEs with a large Ly\ensuremathα EW have a
  small ellipticity. This is consistent with the recent theoretical claims that Ly\ensuremathα
  photons can more easily escape from face-on disks having a small ellipticity, due
  to less inter- stellar gas along the line of sight, although our K-S test indicates
  that this trend is not statistically significant. Our results of Ly\ensuremathα-EW
  dependence generally support the idea that an H I column density is a key quantity
  determining Ly\ensuremathα emissivity. <P />Based on data obtained with the Subaru
  Telescope operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.'
