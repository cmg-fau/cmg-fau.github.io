abstract: 'We study the interactions of a relativistic jet with a dense turbulent
  gaseous disc of radius Ìƒ2 kpc. We have performed a suite of simulations with different
  mean density, jet power, and orientation. Our results show that: (A) The relativistic
  jet couples strongly with the gas in the inner kpc, creating a cavity and launching
  outflows. (B) The high pressure bubble inflated by the jet and its back-flow compresses
  the disc at the outer edges, driving inflows within the disc. (C) Jets inclined
  towards the disc affect the disc more and launch sub- relativistic, wide-angled
  outflows along the minor axis. (D) Shocks driven directly by the jet and the jet-driven
  energy bubble raise the velocity dispersion throughout the disc by several times
  its initial value. (E) Compression by the jet- driven shocks can enhance the star
  formation rate in the disc, especially in a ring-like geometry close to the axis.
  However, enhanced turbulent dispersion in the disc also leads to quenching of star
  formation. Whether positive or negative feedback dominates depends on jet power,
  ISM density, jet orientation with respect to the disc, and the time-scale under
  consideration. Qualitatively, our simulations compare favourably with kinematic
  and morphological signatures of several observed galaxies such as NGC 1052, NGC
  3079, 3C 326, and 3C 293. <P />'
