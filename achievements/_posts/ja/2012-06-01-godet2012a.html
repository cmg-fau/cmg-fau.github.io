abstract: The hyperluminous X-ray source HLX-1 in the galaxy ESO 243-49, currently
  the best intermediate-mass black hole (BH) candidate, displays spectral transitions
  similar to those observed in Galactic BH binaries, but with a luminosity 100-1000
  times higher. We investigated the X-ray properties of this unique source by fitting
  multi-epoch data collected by Swift, XMM-Newton, and Chandra with a disk model computing
  spectra for a wide range of sub- and super-Eddington accretion rates assuming a
  non-spinning BH and a face-on disk (i = 0°). Under these assumptions we find that
  the BH in HLX-1 is in the intermediate- mass range (åisebox-0.5ex~2 × 10$^4$ M $_☉$)
  and the accretion flow is in the sub- Eddington regime. The disk radiation efficiency
  is \ensuremathη = 0.11 \ensuremath± 0.03. We also show that the source does follow
  the L$_X$ vprop T $^4$ relation for our mass estimate. At the outburst peaks, the
  source radiates near the Eddington limit. The accretion rate then stays constant
  around 4 × 10$^-4$ M $_☉$ yr$^-1$ for several days and then decreases exponentially.
  Such ``plateaus'' in the accretion rate could be evidence that enhanced mass- transfer
  rate is the driving outburst mechanism in HLX-1. We also report on the new outburst
  observed in 2011 August by the Swift X-Ray Telescope. The time of this new outburst
  further strengthens the \i̊sebox-0.5ex~1 year recurrence timescale.
