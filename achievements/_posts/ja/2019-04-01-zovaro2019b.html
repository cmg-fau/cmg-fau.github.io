abstract: We report the discovery of shocked molecular and ionized gas resulting from
  jet-driven feedback in the low-redshift (z = 0.0602) compact radio galaxy 4C 31.04
  using near-IR imaging spectroscopy. 4C 31.04 is a ̃100 pc double-lobed Compact Steep
  Spectrum source believed to be a very young active galactic nucleus (AGN). It is
  hosted by a giant elliptical with a ̃ 10$^9$ M_☉ multiphase gaseous circumnuclear
  disc. We used high spatial resolution, adaptive optics-assisted H- and K-band integral
  field Gemini/NIFS observations to probe (1) the warm (̃10$^3$ K) molecular gas phase,
  traced by ro-vibrational transitions of H$_2$, and (2), the warm ionized medium,
  traced by the [Fe II]_\1.644 \ensuremathμ m\ line. The [Fe II] emission traces shocked
  gas ejected from the disc plane by a jet-blown bubble 300-400 pc in diameter, while
  the H$_2$ emission traces shock-excited molecular gas in the interior ̃ 1 kpc of
  the circumnuclear disc. Hydrodynamical modelling shows that the apparent discrepancy
  between the extent of the shocked gas and the radio emission can occur when the
  brightest regions of the synchrotron-emitting plasma are temporarily halted by dense
  clumps, while less bright plasma can percolate through the porous ISM and form an
  energy-driven bubble that expands freely out of the disc plane. Simulations suggest
  that this bubble is filled with low surface brightness plasma not visible in existing
  VLBI observations of 4C 31.04 due to insufficient sensitivity. Additional radial
  flows of jet plasma may percolate to ̃ kpc radii in the circumnuclear disc, driving
  shocks and accelerating clouds of gas, giving rise to the H$_2$ emission.
