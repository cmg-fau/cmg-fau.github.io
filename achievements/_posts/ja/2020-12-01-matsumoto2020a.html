abstract: We study the effects of the magnetic field on the dynamics of non- rotating
  stellar cores by performing 2D, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. To this end,
  we have updated our neutrino- radiation-hydrodynamics supernova code to include
  MHD employing a divergence cleaning method with both careful treatments of finite
  volume and area reconstructions. By changing the initial strength of the magnetic
  field, the evolution of 15.0, 18.4, and $27.0\,m̊ M_ødot$ pre-supernova progenitors
  is investigated. An intriguing finding in our study is that the neutrino-driven
  explosion occurs regardless of the strength of the initial magnetic field. For the
  2D models presented in this work, the neutrino heating is the main driver for the
  explosion, whereas the magnetic field secondary contributes to the pre-explosion
  dynamics. Our results show that the strong magnetic field weakens the growth of
  the neutrino-driven turbulence in the small scale compared to the weak magnetic
  field. This results in the slower increase of the turbulent kinetic energy in the
  post- shock region, leading to the slightly delayed onset of the shock revival for
  models with the stronger initial magnetic field.
