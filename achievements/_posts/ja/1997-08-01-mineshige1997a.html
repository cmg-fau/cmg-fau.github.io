abstract: Self-similar solutions for the time evolution of polytropic, self- gravitating
  viscous disks is found on the condition that the kinematic viscosity is nu åisebox-0.5ex~
  r(\l\ and the gas pressure is P \i̊sebox-0.5ex~ rho (Gamma ) , where l and Gamma
  are free parameters, r is radius, and rho is density. This solution describes a
  self-similar collapse of a rotating gas disk via self-gravity and viscosity. For
  Gamma &lt; Gc = (3+2l)/(3+l) global accretion solutions exist, provided that 0 &lt;
  l &lt;= 1. Owing to the boundary condition of no radial velocity at the origin,
  mass is accumulated near to the center, giving rise to a strong central concentration;
  the surface density varies as Sigma \rs̊ebox-0.5ex~ r(-1-(2)/(3)l) . In the outer
  portions, in contrast, the surface density more slowly decreases outward as Sigma
  \rae̊box-0.5ex~ r(-Gamma /(2-Gamma )) . For Gamma &gt; Gc , conversely, no global
  accretion solution is found. <P />
