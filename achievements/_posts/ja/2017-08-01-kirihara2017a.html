abstract: We examine the nature, possible orbits and physical properties of the progenitor
  of the north-western stellar stream (NWS) in the halo of the Andromeda galaxy (M31).
  The progenitor is assumed to be an accreting dwarf galaxy with globular clusters
  (GCs). It is, in general, difficult to determine the progenitor's orbit precisely
  because of many necessary parameters. Recently, Veljanoski et al. reported five
  GCs whose positions and radial velocities suggest an association with the stream.
  We use these data to constrain the orbital motions of the progenitor using test-particle
  simulations. Our simulations split the orbit solutions into two branches according
  to whether the stream ends up in the foreground or in the background of M31. Upcoming
  observations that will determine the distance to the NWS will be able to reject
  one of the two branches. In either case, the solutions require that the pericentric
  radius of any possible orbit be over 2 kpc. We estimate the efficiency of the tidal
  disruption and confirm the consistency with the assumption for the progenitor being
  a dwarf galaxy. The progenitor requires the mass \ensuremath\gtrsim 2 × 10$^6$ M$_☉$
  and half-light radius \ensuremath\gtrsim 30 pc. In addition, N-body simulations
  successfully reproduce the basic observed features of the NWS and the GCs' line-of-sight
  velocities.
