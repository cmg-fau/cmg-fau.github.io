abstract: To what extent can the one-dimensional slim disk model reproduce the multi-dimensional
  results of global radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of super-Eddington accretion?
  With this question in mind, we perform a systematic simulation study of accretion
  flow onto a non-spinning black hole for a variety of black hole masses of (10-10$^7$)
  M$_☉$ and mass accretion rates of (1.4 × 10$^2$-5.6 × 10$^3$) L$_Edd$/c$^2$ (with
  L$_Edd$ and c being the Eddington luminosity and the speed of light). In order to
  adequately resolve large-scale outflow structure, we extensively expand a simulation
  box to cover the space of 3000 r$_S$ (with r$_S$ being the Schwarzschild radius),
  larger than those in most previous studies, so that we can put relatively large
  angular momentum on the gas injected from the outer simulation boundary. The adopted
  Keplerian radius, at which the centrifugal force balances the gravitational force,
  is r$_K$ = 300 r$_S$. The injected mass first falls and is accumulated at around
  this radius and then slowly accretes toward the central black hole via viscosity.
  We simulate such accretion processes, taking inverse and bulk Compton scattering
  into account. The simulated accretion flow is in a quasi-steady state inside r$_qss$
  ̃ 200 r$_S$. Within this radius the flow properties are, on the whole, in good agreement
  with those described by the slim disk model except that the radial density profile
  of the underlying disk is much flatter, \ensuremathh̊o \ensuremath∝ r$^-0.73$ (cf.
  \ensuremath\o̊ \ensuremath∝ r$^-3/2$ in the slim disk model), due probably to efficient
  convection. We find very weak outflow from inside r ̃ 200 r$_S$, unlike the previous
  studies.
