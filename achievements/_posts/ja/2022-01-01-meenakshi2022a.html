<p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >We use the results of relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of jet- interstellar medium (ISM)
interactions in a galaxy with a radio- loud AGN to quantify the extent of ionization in the
central few kpcs of the gaseous galactic disc. We perform post-process radiative transfer of
AGN radiation through the simulated gaseous jet-perturbed disc to estimate the
extent of photo- ionization by the AGN with an incident luminosity of 10<sup><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">45</span></sup> erg s<sup><span 
class="txsy-x-x-74">-</span><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">1</span></sup>.
We also map the gas that is collisionally ionized due to shocks driven by the jet.
The analysis was carried out for simulations with similar jet power (10<sup><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">45</span></sup> erg s<sup><span 
class="txsy-x-x-74">-</span><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">1</span></sup>)
but different jet orientations with respect to the gas disc. We find that the shocks
from the jets can ionize a significant fraction (up to 33 <span 
class="txmi-"> per</span><span 
class="txmi-"> cent</span>) of dense gas
(<span 
class="txmi-">n</span><span 
class="txr-">100</span><span style="margin-left:0.3em" class="thinspace"></span><span 
class="txr-">cm</span><sup><span 
class="txsy-x-x-74">-</span><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">3</span></sup>) in the disc, and that the jets clear out the central regions of gas for
AGN radiation to penetrate to larger distances in the disc. Jets inclined towards the
disc plane couple more strongly with the ISM and ionize a larger fraction of gas
in the disc as compared to the vertical jet. However, similar to previous studies,
we find that the AGN radiation is quickly absorbed by the outer layers of dense
clouds in the disc, and is not able to substantially ionize the disc on a global scale.
Thus, compared to jet-ISM interactions, we expect that photo-ionization by the
AGN radiation only weakly affects the star-formation activity in the central regions
of the galactic disc (<span 
class="txsya-">≲ </span>1 kpc), although the jet-induced shocks can spread farther
out.</p>
