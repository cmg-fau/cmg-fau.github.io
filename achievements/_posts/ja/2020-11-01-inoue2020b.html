abstract: We devise a physical model of formation and distribution of molecular gas
  clouds (MGCs) in galaxies. We use the model to predict the intensities of rotational
  transition lines of carbon monoxide (CO) and the molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) abundance.
  Using the outputs of IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations, we populate MGCs of
  unresolved sizes in individual simulated galaxies, where the effect of the interstellar
  radiation field with dust attenuation is also taken into account. We then use the
  publicly available code DESPOTIC (Derive the Energetics and SPectra of Optically
  Thick Interstellar Clouds) to compute the CO line luminosities and H$_2$ densities
  without assuming the CO- to-H$_2$ conversion factor (\ensuremathα$_CO$). Our method
  allows us to study the spatial and kinematic structures traced by CO(1-0) and higher
  transition lines. We compare the CO luminosities and H$_2$ masses with recent observations
  of galaxies at low and high redshifts. Our model reproduces well the observed CO-luminosity
  function and the estimated H$_2$ mass in the local UniverseAbout 10 per cent of
  molecules in the Universe reside in dwarf galaxies with stellar masses lower than
  10$^9$ M$_☉$, but the galaxies are generally 'CO-dark' and have typically high \ensuremathα$_CO$.
  Our model predicts generally lower CO line luminosities than observations at redshifts
  z \ensuremath\gtrsim 1-2. We argue that the difference can be explained by the highly
  turbulent structure suggested for the high-redshift star-forming galaxies.
