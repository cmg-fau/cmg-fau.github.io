abstract: The effects of radiation force by the cosmic background radiation (CBR)
  on early-formed objects shortly after the cosmological recombination are explored.
  In particular, we are interested in the angular momentum transport in massive disks
  that originate from tidally spun-up density fluctuations. The radiation force by
  the CBR is calculated by solving the radiative transfer equation and including Thomson
  scattering, under the assumption that a disk is locally approximated to be a plane-parallel
  medium in longitudinal motion. As a numerical technique, we employ a variable Eddington
  factor method. The results show that the efficiency of angular momentum extraction
  by the CBR decreases exponentially with optical depth even if the radiative diffusion
  is effective. This implies that the photon-scattering process in moving media proceeds
  just like the pure absorption process as far as momentum or angular momentum transport
  is concerned. Because of the present effects, the distributions of the spin probability
  of early-formed disks could be significantly modified in the presence of the strong
  CBR. An optically thin disk originating from a large spin parameter (\ensuremathłambda
  &gt; 0.05) would shed angular momentum until it becomes optically thick, resulting
  in \ensuremathłambda åisebox-0.5ex~ 0.05, almost regardless of mass scales of objects
  and the initial power spectrum. Also, the CBR force likely helps to enhance the
  effects of shear viscosity, thereby enabling a seed black hole form at z &gt; 10
  to account for quasar formation.
