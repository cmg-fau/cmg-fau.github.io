abstract: Low-luminosity radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) are of importance
  in studies concerning feedback from radio AGN since a dominant fraction of AGN belong
  to this class. We report high-resolution Very Large Array (VLA) and European VLBI
  Network (EVN) observations of H I 21 cm absorption from a young, compact steep-spectrum
  radio source, B2 0258+35, nested in the early- type galaxy NGC 1167, which contains
  a 160 kpc H I disc. Our VLA and EVN H I absorption observations, modelling, and
  comparison with molecular gas data suggest that the cold gas in the centre of NGC
  1167 is very turbulent (with a velocity dispersion of Ìƒ90 km s$^-1$) and that this
  turbulence is induced by the interaction of the jets with the interstellar medium
  (ISM). Furthermore, the ionised gas in the galaxy shows evidence of shock heating
  at a few kpc from the radio source. These findings support the results from numerical
  simulations of radio jets expanding into a clumpy gas disc, which predict that the
  radio jets in this case percolate through the gas disc and drive shocks into the
  ISM at distances much larger than their physical extent. These results expand the
  number of low-luminosity radio sources found to impact the surrounding medium, thereby
  highlighting the possible relevance of these AGN for feedback. <P />Reduced images
