abstract: We present a novel Lyman alpha (Ly \ensuremathα) radiative transfer code,
  SEURAT (SPH scheme Extended with Ultraviolet line RAdiative Transfer), where line
  scatterings are solved adaptively with the resolution of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics
  (SPH). The radiative transfer method implemented in SEURAT is based on a Monte Carlo
  algorithm in which the scattering and absorption by dust are also incorporated.
  We perform standard test calculations to verify the validity of the code; (i) emergent
  spectra from a static uniform sphere, (ii) emergent spectra from an expanding uniform
  sphere, and (iii) escape fraction from a dusty slab. Thereby, we demonstrate that
  our code solves the \Ly\ \ensuremathα radiative transfer with sufficient accuracy.
  We emphasize that SEURAT can treat the transfer of \Ly\ \ensuremathα photons even
  in highly complex systems that have significantly inhomogeneous density fields.
  The high adaptivity of SEURAT is desirable to solve the propagation of \Ly\ \ensuremathα
  photons in the interstellar medium of young star-forming galaxies like \Ly\ \ensuremathα
  emitters (LAEs). Thus, SEURAT provides a powerful tool to model the emergent spectra
  of \Ly\ \ensuremathα emission, which can be compared to the observations of LAEs.
