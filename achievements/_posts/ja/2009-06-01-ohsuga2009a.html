abstract: Black-hole accretion systems are known to possess several distinct modes
  (or spectral states), such as low/hard state, high/soft state, and so on. Since
  the dynamics of the corresponding flows is distinct, theoretical models were separately
  discussed for each state. We here propose a unified model based on our new, global,
  two-dimensional radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations. By controlling a density
  normalization we could for the first time reproduce three distinct modes of accretion
  flow and outflow with one numerical code. When the density is large (model A), a
  geometrically thick, very luminous disk forms, in which photon trapping takes place.
  When the density is moderate (model B), the accreting gas can effectively cool by
  emitting radiation, thus generating a thin disk, i.e., the soft-state disk. When
  the density is too low for radiative cooling to be important (model C), a disk becomes
  hot, thick, and faint; i.e., the hard-state disk. The magnetic energy is amplified
  within the disk up to about twice, 30%, and 20% of the gas energy in models A, B,
  and C, respectively. Notably, the disk outflows with helical magnetic fields, which
  are driven either by radiation pressure force or magnetic pressure force, are ubiquitous
  in any accretion modes. Finally, our simulations are consistent with the phenomenological
  alpha-viscosity prescription, that is, the disk viscosity is proportional to the
  pressure.
