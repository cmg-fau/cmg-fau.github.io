<p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >With unprecedented angular resolution, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has opened a
new era of black hole studies. We have previously calculated the expected polarization
images of M 87* with EHT observations in mind. There, we demonstrated that circular
polarization (CP) images, as well as linear polarization (LP) maps, can convey quite useful
information, such as the flow structure and magnetic field configuration around the black
hole. In this paper, we make new predictions for the cases in which disk emission
dominates over jet emission, bearing Sgr A* in mind. Here we set the proton-to-electron
temperature ratio of the disk component to be T<sub><span 
class="txmi-x-x-74">p</span></sub>/T<sub><span 
class="txmi-x-x-74">e</span></sub> ~2 so as to suppress jet emission
relative to emission from accretion flow. As a result, we obtain ring-like images and
triple-forked images around the black hole for face-on and edge-on cases, respectively.
We also find significant CP components in the images (<span 
class="txsya-">â‰³</span>10% in fraction), with
both positive and negative signs, amplified through the Faraday conversion, not
depending sensitively on the inclination angles. Furthermore, we find a &#8220;separatrix&#8221;
in the CP images, across which the sign of CP is reversed and on which the LP
flux is brightest, that can be attributed to the helical magnetic field structure in the
disk. These results indicate that future full polarization EHT images are a quite
useful tracer of the magnetic field structure. We also discuss to what extent we will
be able to extract information regarding magnetic field configurations under the
scattering in the interstellar plasma, in future EHT polarimetric observations of Sgr
A*.</p>
