abstract: We explore the formation of secondary Population III (Pop III) stars under
  radiation hydrodynamic (RHD) feedback by a preformed massive star. To properly treat
  RHD feedback, we perform three- dimensional RHD simulations incorporating the radiative
  transfer of ionizing photons as well as H$_2$ dissociating photons from a preformed
  star. A collapsing gas cloud is settled at a given distance from a 120 M $_sun$
  Pop III star, and the evolution of the cloud is pursued including RHD feedback.
  We derive the threshold density depending on the distance, above which the cloud
  can keep collapsing owing to the shielding of H$_2$ dissociating radiation. We find
  that an H$_2$ shell formed ahead of an ionizing front works effectively to shield
  the H$_2$ dissociating radiation, leading to the positive feedback for the secondary
  Pop III star formation. Also, near the threshold density, the envelope of gas cloud
  is stripped significantly by a shock associated with an ionizing front. By comparing
  the mass accretion timescale with the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale, we estimate the
  mass of secondary Pop III stars. It turns out that the stripping by a shock can
  reduce the mass of secondary Pop III stars down to \ensuremathâ‰ˆ20 M $_sun$.
