abstract: We present a simple model that explains the origin of warm, diffuse gas
  seen primarily as highly ionized absorption-line systems in the spectra of background
  sources. We predict the observed column densities of several highly ionized transitions
  such as O VI, O vii, Ne viii, N v, and Mg x, and we present a unified comparison
  of the model predictions with absorption lines seen in the Milky Way disk, Milky
  Way halo, starburst galaxies, the circumgalactic medium, and the intergalactic medium
  at low and high redshifts. We show that diffuse gas seen in such diverse environments
  can be simultaneously explained by a simple model of radiatively cooling gas. We
  show that most such absorption-line systems are consistent with being collisionally
  ionized, and we estimate the maximum-likelihood temperature of the gas in each observation.
  This model satisfactorily explains why O VI is regularly observed around star-forming
  low-z L* galaxies, and why N v is rarely seen around the same galaxies. We further
  present some consequences of this model in quantifying the dynamics of the cooling
  gas around galaxies and predict the shock velocities associated with such flows.
  A unique strength of this model is that while it has only one free (but physically
  well- constrained) parameter, it nevertheless successfully reproduces the available
  data on O VI absorbers in the interstellar, circumgalactic, intragroup, and intergalactic
  media, as well as the available data on other absorption lines from highly ionized
  species.
