abstract: We explore possibilities of collapse and star formation in Population III
  objects exposed to the external ultraviolet background (UVB) radiation. Assuming
  spherical symmetry, we solve self- consistently radiative transfer of photons, non-equilibrium
  H$_2$ chemistry and gas hydrodynamics. Although the UVB does suppress the formation
  of low-mass objects, the negative feedback turns out to be weaker than previously
  suggested. In particular, the cut-off scale of collapse drops significantly below
  the virial temperature T$_vir$åisebox-0.5ex~10$^4$K at weak UV intensities (J$_21$&lt;\i̊sebox-0.5ex~10$^-2$),
  owing to both self-shielding of the gas and H$_2$ cooling. Clouds above this cut-off
  tend to contract highly dynamically, further promoting self-shielding and H$_2$
  formation. For plausible radiation intensities and spectra, the collapsing gas can
  cool efficiently to temperatures well below 10$^4$K before rotationally supported
  and the final H$_2$ fraction reaches \rs̊ebox-0.5ex~10$^-3$. <P />Our results imply
  that star formation can take place in low-mass objects collapsing in the UVB. The
  threshold baryon mass for star formation is \rae̊box-0.5ex~10$^9$M$_solar$ for clouds
  collapsing at redshifts z&lt;\raib̊ox-0.5ex~3, but drops significantly at higher
  redshifts. In a conventional cold dark matter universe, the latter coincides roughly
  with that of the 1\ensuremathσ density fluctuations. Objects near and above this
  threshold can thus constitute `building blocks' of luminous structures, and we discuss
  their links to dwarf spheroidal/elliptical galaxies and faint blue objects. These
  results suggest that the UVB can play a key role in regulating the star formation
  history of the Universe. <P />
