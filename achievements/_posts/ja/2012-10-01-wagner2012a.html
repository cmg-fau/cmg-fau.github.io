abstract: We examine the detailed physics of the feedback mechanism by relativistic
  active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets interacting with a two-phase fractal interstellar
  medium (ISM) in the kpc-scale core of galaxies using 29 three-dimensional grid-based
  hydrodynamical simulations. The feedback efficiency, as measured by the amount of
  cloud dispersal generated by the jet-ISM interactions, is sensitive to the maximum
  size of clouds in the fractal cloud distribution but not to their volume filling
  factor. Feedback ceases to be efficient for Eddington ratios P $_jet$/L $_edd$ &lt;åisebox-0.5ex~
  10$^-4$, although systems with large cloud complexes &gt;\i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 50 pc require
  jets of Eddington ratio in excess of 10$^-2$ to disperse the clouds appreciably.
  Based on measurements of the bubble expansion rates in our simulations, we argue
  that sub-grid AGN prescriptions resulting in negative feedback in cosmological simulations
  without a multi-phase treatment of the ISM are good approximations if the volume
  filling factor of warm-phase material is less than 0.1 and the cloud complexes are
  smaller than \rs̊ebox-0.5ex~25 pc. We find that the acceleration of the dense embedded
  clouds is provided by the ram pressure of the high-velocity flow through the porous
  channels of the warm phase, flow that has fully entrained the shocked hot-phase
  gas it has swept up, and is additionally mass loaded by ablated cloud material.
  This mechanism transfers 10% to 40% of the jet energy to the cold and warm gas,
  accelerating it within a few 10 to 100 Myr to velocities that match those observed
  in a range of high- and low-redshift radio galaxies hosting powerful radio jets.
