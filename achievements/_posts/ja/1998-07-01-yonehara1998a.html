abstract: The innermost regions of quasars can be resolved by a gravitational lens
  ``telescope`` on scales down to a few AU. For this purpose, X-ray observations are
  most preferable because X-rays originating from the innermost regions can be selectively
  amplified by microlensing resulting from the ``caustic crossing.'' If detected,
  X-ray variations will constrain the size of the X-ray-emitting region down to a
  few AU. The maximum attainable resolution depends mainly on the monitoring intervals
  of lens events, which should be much shorter than the crossing time. On the basis
  of this idea, we performed numerical simulations of microlensing of an optically
  thick, standard-type disk as well as an optically thin, advection-dominated accretion
  flow (ADAF). Calculated spectral variations and light curves show distinct behaviors,
  depending on the photon energy. X-ray radiation that is produced in optically thin
  region exhibits intensity variation over a few tens of days. In contrast, optical-UV
  fluxes, which are likely to come from optically thick region, exhibit more gradual
  light changes, which is consistent with the microlensing events so far observed
  in Q2237+0305. Currently, Q2237+0305 is being monitored in the optical range at
  Apache Point Observatory. Simultaneous multiwavelength observations by X-ray satellites
  (e.g., ASCA, AXAF, XMM) as well as HST at the moment of a microlens event enable
  us to reveal an AU-scale structure of the central accretion disk around a black
  hole.
