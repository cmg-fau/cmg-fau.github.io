abstract: Accretion disks as well as disk accretion driven by external radiation drag
  are presented under a steady approximation in the cases of the point-mass potential
  and of the dark-matter potential. We assume that the external drag force can be
  expressed as -beta \mbox \v\\, where beta is a constant coefficient and \v\ the
  velocity vector. When the gravitational potential is given by a central point-mass
  M, we find, in a cold regime where the pressure force is neglected, steady solutions
  such that the infalling velocity v_r is expressed as v_r = -beta r far from the
  center and as v_r = -2beta r near the center, where r is the distance from the center,
  while the rotation velocity v_\ensuremathϕ is constant far from the center and almost
  Keplerian (i.e., v_\ensuremathϕ = sqrt \GM/r\) near the center. In a warm regime,
  where the effect of the gas pressure is taken into account, a transonic solution
  is found, where the flow accretes supersonically far from the center, passes a sonic
  point, and eventually becomes subsonic, but rotating in a nearly Keplerian orbit.
  When the dark matter exerts a gravitational force, which is assumed to be -rOmega_DM
  (2) (Omega_DM = const.), we find steady analytical solutions in the cold regime
  such that v_r = - (beta /2)r and v_\ensuremathϕ = rsqrt \Omega_DM (2-beta 2̂/4\)
  . The effect of the gas pressure is also discussed. Such accretion disks, where
  the angular momentum is removed via an external radiative drag proportional to the
  velocity (beta disk), are possible in the post-recombination epoch during the early
  universe. Shortly after the cosmological recombination era, when the radiation density
  of the cosmic background radiation (CBR) was sufficiently high, the gas could lose
  its angular momentum efficiently through Compton drag with the CBR and, consequently,
  form cosmological accretion disks which evolve into primordial active galactic nuclei
  (proto-quasars). In a dark matter- dominated universe, the disk gas would initially
  accrete in the dark-matter potential, eventually forming a central black hole with
  effectively point-mass potential.
