abstract: We fit the observed high-ionization X-ray absorption lines in the neutron
  star binary GX13 + 1 with a full simulation of a thermal-radiative wind. This uses
  a radiation hydrodynamic code coupled to Monte Carlo radiation transfer to compute
  the observed line profiles from hydrogen and helium-like iron and nickel, including
  all strong K \ensuremathα and K \ensuremathβ transitions. The wind is very strong
  as this object has a very large disc and is very luminous. The absorption lines
  from Fe K \ensuremathα are strongly saturated as the ion columns are large, so the
  line equivalent widths depend sensitively on the velocity structure. We additionally
  simulate the lines including isotropic turbulence at the level of the azimuthal
  and radial velocities. We fit these models to the Fe XXV and XXVI absorption lines
  seen in the highest resolution Chandra third-order high-energy transmission grating
  spectrometer data. These data already rule out the addition of turbulence at the
  level of the radial velocity of \ensuremath∼500 km s$^-1$. The velocity structure
  predicted by the thermal-radiative wind alone is a fairly good match to the observed
  profile, with an upper limit to additional turbulence at the level of the azimuthal
  velocity of \ensuremath∼100 km s$^-1$. This gives stringent constraints on any remaining
  contribution from magnetic acceleration.
