abstract: We show the best current simulations of the absorption and emission features
  predicted from thermal-radiative winds produced from X-ray illumination of the outer
  accretion disc in binary systems. We use the density and velocity structure derived
  from a radiation hydrodynamic code as input to a Monte Carlo radiation transport
  calculation. The initial conditions are matched to those of the black hole binary
  system H1743-322 in its soft, disc dominated state, where wind features are seen
  in Chandra grating data. Our simulation fits well to the observed line profile,
  showing that these physical wind models can be the origin of the absorption features
  seen, rather than requiring a magnetically driven wind. We show how the velocity
  structure is the key observable discriminator between magnetic and thermal winds.
  Magnetic winds are faster at smaller radii, whereas thermal winds transition to
  a static atmosphere at smaller radii. New data from XRISM (due for launch 2022 January)
  will give an unprecedented view of the physics of the wind launch and acceleration
  processes, but the existence of static atmospheres in small disc systems already
  rules out magnetic winds which assume self-similar magnetic fields from the entire
  disc as the origin of the absorption features seen.
