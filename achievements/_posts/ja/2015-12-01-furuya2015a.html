abstract: 'We investigate the water deuteration ratio and ortho-to-para nuclear spin
  ratio of H$_2$ (OPR(H$_2$)) during the formation and early evolution of a molecular
  cloud, following the scenario that accretion flows sweep and accumulate H i gas
  to form molecular clouds. We follow the physical evolution of post-shock materials
  using a one-dimensional shock model, combined with post-processing gas-ice chemistry
  simulations. This approach allows us to study the evolution of the OPR(H$_2$) and
  water deuteration ratio without an arbitrary assumption of the initial molecular
  abundances, including the initial OPR(H$_2$). When the conversion of hydrogen into
  H$_2$ is almost complete the OPR(H$_2$) is already much smaller than the statistical
  value of three because of the spin conversion in the gas phase. As the gas accumulates,
  the OPR(H$_2$) decreases in a non-equilibrium manner. We find that water ice can
  be deuterium-poor at the end of its main formation stage in the cloud, compared
  to water vapor observed in the vicinity of low-mass protostars where water ice is
  sublimated. If this is the case, the enrichment of deuterium in water should mostly
  occur at somewhat later evolutionary stages of star formation, i.e., cold prestellar/protostellar
  cores. The main mechanism to suppress water ice deuteration in the cloud is the
  cycle of photodissociation and reformation of water ice, which efficiently removes
  deuterium from water ice chemistry. The removal efficiency depends on the main formation
  pathway of water ice. The OPR(H$_2$) plays a minor role in water ice deuteration
  at the main formation stage of water ice. <P />Appendices are available in electronic
