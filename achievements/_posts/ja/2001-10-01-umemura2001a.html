abstract: As a potential mechanism to build up supermassive black holes (BHs) in a
  spheroidal system, we consider the radiation drag effect by bulge stars, which extracts
  angular momentum from interstellar gas and thus allows the gas to accrete onto the
  galactic center. By incorporating the radiation hydrodynamical equation with simple
  stellar evolution, it is shown that the BH-to-bulge mass ratio, f$_BH$, is basically
  determined by a fundamental constant, that is, the energy conversion efficiency
  for nuclear fusion of hydrogen to helium, \ensuremathın=0.007. More specifically,
  f$_BH$ is predicted to be 0.3\ensuremathın-0.5\ensuremathın. Based on the present
  model for BH growth, a scenario for quasar formation is addressed in relation to
  ultraluminous infrared galaxies. <P />
