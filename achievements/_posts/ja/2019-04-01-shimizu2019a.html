abstract: We study various implementations of a supernova (SN) feedback model and
  present the results of our `Osaka feedback model' using isolated galaxy simulations
  performed by the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code GADGET-3. Our model is a modified
  version of Stinson et al.'s work, and we newly add the momentum kick for SN feedback
  rather than only thermal feedback. We incorporate the physical properties of SN
  remnants from the results of Chevalier and McKee &amp; Ostriker, such as the effective
  radius of the SN bubble and the remnant lifetime, in the form of Sedov-Taylor- like
  solutions with the effect of radiative cooling. Our model utilizes the local physical
  parameters such as the density and temperature of the interstellar medium rather
  than galactic or halo properties to determine the galactic wind velocity or mass-
  loading factor. The Osaka model succeeds in self-regulating star formation, and
  naturally produces galactic outflow with variable velocities depending on the local
  environment and available SN energy as a function of time. An important addition
  to our previous work by Aoyama et al. is the implementation of the CELIB chemistry
  library, which allows us to deal with the time- dependent input of energy and metal
  yields for Type Ia and II supernovae and asymptotic giant branch stars. As initial
  tests of our model, we apply it to isolated galaxy simulations, and examine various
  galactic properties and compare them with observational data, including metal abundances.
