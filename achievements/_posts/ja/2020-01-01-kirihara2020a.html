abstract: We investigate the distribution of metals in the cosmological volume at
  z \ensuremath∼ 3, in particular, provided by massive Population III (Pop III) stars
  using a cosmological N-body simulation in which a model of Pop III star formation
  is implemented. Owing to the simulation, we can choose minihaloes where Pop III
  star formation occurs at z &gt; 10 and obtain the spatial distribution of the metals
  at lower redshifts. To evaluate the amount of heavy elements provided by Pop III
  stars, we consider metal yield of pair-instability or core-collapse supernovae (SNe)
  explosions of massive stars. By comparing our results to the Illustris-1 simulation,
  we find that heavy elements provided by Pop III stars often dominate those from
  galaxies in low-density regions. The median value of the volume averaged metallicity
  is Z̃ 10\̂-4.5 - -2\ Z_\☉ \ at the regions. Spectroscopic observations with the
  next generation telescopes are expected to detect the metals imprinted on quasar
  spectra.
