abstract: Using highly accurate N-body simulations, we explore the evolution of multiple
  massive black holes (hereafter MBHs) in a primordial galaxy that is composed of
  stars and MBHs. The evolution is pursed with a fourth-order Hermite scheme, where
  not only three- body interaction of MBHs but also dynamical friction by stars are
  incorporated. Initially, 10 MBHs with equal masses of 10$^7$ M $_sun$ are set in
  a host galaxy with 10$^11$ M $_sun$. It is found that 4-6 MBHs merge successively
  within 1 Gyr, emitting gravitational wave radiation. The key process for the successive
  merger of MBHs is the dynamical friction by field stars, which enhances three-body
  interactions of MBHs when they enter the central regions of the galaxy. The heaviest
  MBH always composes a close binary at the galactic center, which shrinks owing to
  the angular momentum transfer by the third MBH and eventually merges. The angular
  momentum transfer by the third MBH is due to the sling-shot mechanism. We find that
  the secular Kozai mechanism does not work for a binary to merge if we include the
  relativistic pericenter shift. The simulations show that a multiple MBH system can
  produce a heavier MBH at the galactic center purely through N-body process. This
  merger path can be of great significance for the growth of MBHs in a primordial
  galaxy. The merger of multiple MBHs may be a potential source of gravitational waves
  for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and pulsar timing.
