abstract: We study influence by models of interstellar medium (ISM) on properties
  of galaxies in cosmological simulations. We examine three models widely used in
  previous studies. The ISM models impose different equations of state on dense gas.
  Using zoom-in simulations, we demonstrate that switching the ISM models can control
  formation of giant clumps in massive discs at redshifts z Ìƒ 1-2, while their initial
  conditions and the other settings such as stellar feedback are unchanged. Thus,
  not only feedback but ISM models can also be responsible for clumpy morphologies
  of simulated galaxies. We find, however, that changing the ISM models hardly affects
  global properties of galaxies, such as the total stellar and gas masses, star formation
  rate, metallicity, and stellar angular momentum, irrespective of the significant
  difference of clumpiness; namely the ISM models only change clumpiness of discs.
  In addition, our approach provides a test to investigate impact by clump formation
  on the evolution of disc galaxies using the same initial conditions and feedback.
  We find that clump formation does not significantly alter the properties of galaxies
  and therefore could not be the causes of starburst or quenching.
