abstract: To unveil a progenitor of the Andromeda Giant Stellar Stream, we investigate
  the interaction between an accreting satellite galaxy and the Andromeda Galaxy using
  an N-body simulation. We perform a comprehensive exploration of the properties of
  the progenitor dwarf galaxy, using 247 models of varying mass, mass distribution,
  and size. We show that the binding energy of the progenitor is the crucial parameter
  in reproducing the Andromeda Giant Stellar Stream and the shell-like structures
  surrounding the Andromeda Galaxy. As a result of the simulations, the progenitor
  must satisfy a simple scaling relation between the core radius, the total mass and
  the tidal radius. Using this relation, we successfully constrain the physical properties
  of the progenitors to have masses ranging from 5× \10\$^8$\M\$_☉ $ to 5× \10\$^9$\M\$_☉
  $ and central surface densities around \10\$^3$ \M\$_☉ $ \\pc\\$^-2$. A detailed
  comparison between our result and the nearby observed galaxies indicates that possible
  progenitors of the Andromeda Giant Stellar Stream include a dwarf elliptical galaxy,
  a dwarf irregular galaxy, and a small spiral galaxy.
