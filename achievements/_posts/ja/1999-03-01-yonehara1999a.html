abstract: The optical-ultraviolet continuum from active galactic nuclei (AGN) seems
  to originate from optically thick and/or thin disks, and occasionally from associated
  circumnuclear starburst regions. These different possible origins can, in principle,
  be distinguished by observations of gravitational microlensing events. We performed
  numerical simulations of microlensing of an AGN disk by a single lensing star passing
  in front of the AGN. Calculated spectral variations and light curves show distinct
  behavior, depending on the nature of the emitting region; time variation over few
  months with strong wavelength dependence is expected in the case of an optically
  thick disk (standard disk), while an optically thin disk (advection-dominated disk)
  will produce shorter, nearly wavelength-independent variation. In the case of an
  associated circumnuclear starburst region much slower variations (over a year) will
  be superposed on the shorter variations caused by microlensing of the disk.
