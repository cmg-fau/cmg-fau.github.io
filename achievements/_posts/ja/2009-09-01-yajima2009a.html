abstract: In order to assess the contribution of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and Lyman
  \ensuremathα emitters (LAEs) at redshifts 3 &lt; z &lt; 7 to the ionization of intergalactic
  medium (IGM), we investigate the escape fractions of ionizing photons from supernova-dominated
  primordial galaxies by solving the three- dimensional (3D) radiative transfer. The
  model galaxy is employed from an ultra-high-resolution chemodynamic simulation of
  a primordial galaxy by Mori &amp; Umemura, which well reproduces the observed properties
  of LAEs and LBGs. The total mass of model galaxy is 10$^11$M$_solar$. We solve not
  only photoionization but also collisional ionization by shocks. In addition, according
  to the chemical enrichment, we incorporate the effect of dust extinction, taking
  the size distributions of dust into account. As a result, we find that dust extinction
  reduces the escape fractions by a factor of 1.5-8.5 in the LAE phase and by a factor
  of 2.5-11 in the LBG phase, while the collisional ionization by shocks increases
  the escape fractions by a factor of åisebox-0.5ex~2. The resultant escape fractions
  are 0.07-0.47 in the LAE phase and 0.06-0.17 in the LBG phase. These results are
  well concordant with the recent estimations derived from the flux density ratio
  at 1500 to 900 \Å of LAEs and LBGs. Combining the resultant escape fractions with
  the luminosity functions of LAEs and LBGs, we find that high-z LAEs and LBGs can
  ionize the IGM at z = 3-5. However, ionizing radiation from LAEs as well as LBGs
  falls short of ionizing the IGM at z &gt; 6. That implies that additional ionization
  sources may be required at z &gt; 6.
