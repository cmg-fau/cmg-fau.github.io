abstract: We report the discovery of 10 kpc [C II] 158 \ensuremathμm halos surrounding
  star-forming galaxies in the early universe. We choose deep Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
  Array data for 18 galaxies, each with a star formation rate of ≃10─70 M $_☉$ with
  no signature of an active galactic nucleus whose [C II] lines are individually detected
  at z = 5.153─7.142, and we conduct stacking of the [C II] lines and dust continuum
  in the uv-visibility plane. The radial profiles of the surface brightnesses show
  a 10 kpc scale [C II] halo at the 9.2\ensuremathσ level, significantly more extended
  than the Hubble Space Telescope stellar continuum data by a factor of \ensuremath∼5
  on the exponential-profile basis, as well as the dust continuum. We compare the
  radial profiles of [C II] and Ly\ensuremathα halos universally found in star- forming
  galaxies at this epoch, and we find that the scale lengths agree within the 1\ensuremathσ
  level. While two independent hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations match the dust and
  stellar continuum properties, the simulations cannot reproduce the extended [C II]
  line emission. The existence of the extended [C II] halo is evidence of outflow
  remnants in the early galaxies and suggests that the outflows may be dominated by
  cold-mode outflows expelling the neutral gas.
