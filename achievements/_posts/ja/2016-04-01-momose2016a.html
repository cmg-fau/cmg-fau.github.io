abstract: We present statistical properties of diffuse Ly\ensuremathα haloes (LAHs)
  around high-z star-forming galaxies with large Subaru samples of Ly\ensuremathα
  emitters (LAEs) at z = 2.2. We make subsamples defined by the physical quantities
  of LAEs' central Ly\ensuremathα luminosities, ultraviolet (UV) magnitudes, Ly\ensuremathα
  equivalent widths, and UV slopes, and investigate LAHs' radial surface brightness
  (SB) profiles and scale lengths r$_n$ as a function of these physical quantities.
  We find that there exist prominent LAHs around LAEs with faint Ly\ensuremathα luminosities,
  bright UV luminosities, and small Ly\ensuremathα equivalent widths in cumulative
  radial Ly\ensuremathα SB profiles. We confirm this trend with the anticorrelation
  between r$_n$ and Ly\ensuremathα luminosities (equivalent widths) based on the Spearman's
  rank correlation coefficient that is \ensuremathh̊o = -0.9 (-0.7) corresponding
  to the 96 per cent (93 per cent) confidence level, although the correlation between
  r$_n$ and UV magnitudes is not clearly found in the rank correlation coefficient.
  Our results suggest that LAEs with properties similar to typical Lyman-break galaxies
  (with faint Ly\ensuremathα luminosities and small equivalent widths) possess more
  prominent LAHs. We investigate scenarios for the major physical origins of LAHs
  with our results. Because we find relatively small Ly\ensuremathα equivalent widths
  up to 77 \Å in LAHs that include LAEs' central components, these results suggest
  that the cold stream scenario is not preferred. There remain two possible scenarios
  of Ly\ensuremathα scattering in circumgalactic medium and satellite galaxies that
  cannot be tested with our observational data.
