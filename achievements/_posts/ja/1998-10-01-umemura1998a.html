abstract: We examine the physical processes of radiatively driven mass accretion on
  to galactic nuclei, owing to intensive radiation from circumnuclear starbursts.
  The radiation from a starburst not only causes the inner gas disc to contract via
  radition flux force, but also extracts angular momentum owing to relativistic radiation
  drag, thereby inducing an avalanche of the surface layer of the disc. To analyse
  such a mechanism, the radiation- hydrodynamical equations are solved, including
  the effects of the radiation drag force as well as the radiation flux force. As
  a result, it is found that the mass accretion rate owing to the radiative avalanche
  is given by Msolar(r)=epsilon(L_*/c2̂)(r/R)\(̂DeltaR/R)(1-e\^âu) at radius r, where
  the efficiency epsilon ranges from 0.2 up to 1, L_* and R are respectively the bolometric
  luminosity and the radius of the starburst ring, DeltaR is the extent of the emission
  regions, and tau is the face-on optical depth of the disc. In an optically thick
  regime, the rate depends upon neither the optical depth nor the surface mass density
  distribution of the disc. The present radiatively driven mass accretion may provide
  a physical mechanism which enables mass accretion from 100-pc scales down to åisebox-0.5ex~parsec
  scales, and it may eventually be linked to advection-dominated viscous accretion
  on to a massive black hole. The radiation-hydrodynamical and self- gravitational
  instabilities of the disc are briefly discussed. In particular, the radiative acceleration
  possibly builds up a dusty wall, which `shades' the nucleus in edge-on views. This
  provides another version of the model for the formation of an obscuring torus.
