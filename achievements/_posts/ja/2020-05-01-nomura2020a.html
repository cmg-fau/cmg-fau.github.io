abstract: Based on recent X-ray observations, ultrafast outflows from supermassive
  black holes are expected to have enough energy to dramatically affect their host
  galaxy but their launch and acceleration mechanisms are not well understood. We
  perform two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations of UV line-driven disc
  winds in order to calculate the mass-loss rates and kinetic power in these models.
  We develop a new iterative technique that reduces the mass accretion rate through
  the inner disc in response to the wind mass-loss. This makes the inner disc less
  UV bright, reducing the wind power compared to previous simulations which assumed
  a constant accretion rate with radius. The line-driven winds in our simulations
  are still extremely powerful, with around half the supplied mass accretion rate
  being ejected in the wind for black holes with mass 10$^8$- $10^10\, \mathrm M_Ã¸dot$
  accreting at L/L$_Edd$ = 0.5-0.9. Our results open up the way for estimating the
  growth rate of supermassive black hole and evaluating the kinetic energy ejected
  into the interstellar medium (active galactic nuclei feedback) based on a physical
  model of line-driven disc winds.
