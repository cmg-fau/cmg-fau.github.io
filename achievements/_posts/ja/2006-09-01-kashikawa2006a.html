abstract: We report an extensive search for Ly\ensuremathα emitters (LAEs) at z=6.5
  in the Subaru Deep Field. Subsequent spectroscopy with Subaru and Keck identified
  eight more LAEs, giving a total of 17 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs at z=6.5.
  Based on this spectroscopic sample of 17, complemented by a photometric sample of
  58 LAEs, we have derived a more accurate Ly\ensuremathα luminosity function of LAEs
  at z=6.5, which reveals an apparent deficit at the bright end of åisebox-0.5ex~0.75
  mag fainter L$^*$, compared with that observed at z=5.7. The difference in the LAE
  luminosity functions between z=5.7 and 6.5 is significant at the 3 \ensuremathσ
  level, which is reduced to 2 \ensuremathσ when cosmic variance is taken into account.
  This result may imply that the reionization of the universe has not been completed
  at z=6.5. We found that the spatial distribution of LAEs at z=6.5 was homogeneous
  over the field. We discuss the implications of these results for the reionization
  of the universe. <P />The data presented herein were partly obtained at the W. M.
  Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California
  Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics
  and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial
  support of the W. M. Keck Foundation. <P />Based in part on data collected at the
  Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of
  Japan.
