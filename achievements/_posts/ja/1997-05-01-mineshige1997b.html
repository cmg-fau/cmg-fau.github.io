abstract: A self-similar solution for time evolution of isothermal, self- gravitating
  viscous disks is found under the condition that \ensuremathα' \ensuremath≡ \ensuremathα(H/r)
  is constant in space (where \ensuremathα is the viscosity parameter and H/r is the
  ratio of a half-thickness to the radius of the disk). This solution describes a
  homologous collapse of a disk via self- gravity and viscosity. The disk structure
  and evolution are distinct in the inner and outer parts. There is a constant mass
  inflow in the outer portions so that the disk has flat rotation velocity, constant
  accretion velocity, and surface density decreasing outward according to \ensuremathΣ
  åisebox-0.5ex~ r$^-1$. In the inner portions, in contrast, mass is accumulated near
  the center owing to the boundary condition of no radial velocity at the origin,
  a strong central concentration being thereby produced; surface density varies according
  to \ensuremathΣ \i̊sebox-0.5ex~ r$^-5/3$. Moreover, the transition radius separating
  the inner and outer portions increases linearly with time. The consequence of such
  a high condensation is briefly discussed in the context of formation of a quasar
  black hole.
