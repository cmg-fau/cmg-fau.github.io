abstract: This study investigates the dynamical response of dark matter (DM) halos
  to recurrent starbursts in forming less-massive galaxies to solve the core-cusp
  problem. The gas, which is heated by supernova feedback after a starburst, expands
  and the star formation then terminates. This expanding gas loses energy by radiative
  cooling and then falls back toward the galactic center. Subsequently, the starburst
  is enhanced again. This cycle of expansion and contraction of the interstellar gas
  leads to a repetitive change in the gravitational potential of the gas. The resonance
  between DM particles and the density wave excited by the oscillating potential plays
  a key role in understanding the physical mechanism of the cusp-core transition of
  DM halos. DM halos effectively gain kinetic energy from the baryon potential through
  the energy transfer driven by the resonance between the particles and density waves.
  We determine that the critical condition for the cusp-core transition is such that
  the oscillation period of the gas potential is approximately the same as the local
  dynamical time of DM halos. We present the resultant core radius of a DM halo after
  the cusp-core transition induced by the resonance by using the conventional mass
  density profile predicted by the cold dark matter models. Moreover, we verify the
  analytical model by using N-body simulations, and the results validate the resonance
  model.
