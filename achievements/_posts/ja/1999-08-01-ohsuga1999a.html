abstract: By considering the radiative force by a circumnuclear starburst as well
  as an active galactic nucleus (AGN), we analyze the equilibrium configuration and
  the stability of dusty gas in the circumnuclear regions. It is found that the radiative
  force by an intensive starburst can support a stable gaseous wall with a scale height
  of several hundred parsecs. Moreover, by taking the simple stellar evolution in
  the starburst into account, we find that the covering factor of the wall decreases
  on a timescale of several times 10$^7$ yr. The large-scale wall, if formed, works
  to obscure the nucleus as a result of the dust opacity. Hence, it is anticipated
  that the index of AGN type tends to shift from higher to lower in several times
  10$^7$ yr as the circumnuclear starburst becomes dimmer. On the other hand, if the
  AGN itself is brighter than the circumnuclear starburst (e.g., the quasar case),
  no stable large-scale wall forms. In that case, the AGN is most probably identified
  as type 1. The present mechanism may provide a physical explanation for the putative
  correlation between AGN type and host properties whereby Seyfert type 2 galaxies
  are more frequently associated with circumnuclear starbursts than type 1 galaxies,
  whereas quasars are mostly observed as type 1 regardless of star-forming activity
  in the host galaxies.
