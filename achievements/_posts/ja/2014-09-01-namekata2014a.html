abstract: We perform three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations of uniform
  dusty gas clouds irradiated by an active galactic nucleus (AGN) to investigate the
  dependence of evolution of clouds on the ionization parameter \U\ and the Strömgren
  number \N\_S. We find that the evolution can be classified into two cases depending
  on \U\. In low \U\ cases (\U\\ensuremath≈ 10\̂-2\), the evolution is mainly driven
  by photoevaporation. An approximately spherically symmetric evaporation flow with
  velocity of 100-150 km s$^- 1$ is launched from the irradiated face. The cloud is
  compressed by a D-type shock losing its mass due to photoevaporation and is finally
  turned into a dense filament by t \ensuremathłesssim 1.5t$_sc$. In high \U\ cases
  (\U\\ensuremath≈ 5× 10\-̂2\), radiation pressure suppresses photoevaporation from
  the central part of the irradiated face, reducing photoevaporation rate. An evaporation
  flow from the outskirts of the irradiated face is turned into a high-velocity (\ensuremathłesssim500
  km s$^-1$) gas wind because of radiation pressure on dust. The cloud is swept by
  a radiation pressure-driven shock and becomes a dense gas disc by t \ensuremath≈
  t$_sweep$. Star formation is expected in these dense regions for both cases of \U\.
  We discuss the influences of the AGN radiation on the clumpy torus. A simple estimate
  suggests that the clumps are destroyed in time-scales shorter than their orbital
  periods. For the clumpy structure to be maintained over long period, the incident
  radiation field needs to be sufficiently weaken for most of the clumps, or, some
  mechanism that creates the clumps continuously is needed.
