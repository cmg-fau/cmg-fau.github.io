abstract: Providing initial conditions is an essential procedure for numerical simulations
  of galaxies. The initial conditions for idealized individual galaxies in N-body
  simulations should resemble observed galaxies and be dynamically stable for time-scales
  much longer than their characteristic dynamical times. However, generating a galaxy
  model ab initio as a system in dynamical equilibrium is a difficult task, since
  a galaxy contains several components, including a bulge, disc, and halo. Moreover,
  it is desirable that the initial-condition generator be fast and easy to use. We
  have now developed an initial-condition generator for galactic N-body simulations
  that satisfies these requirements. The developed generator adopts a distribution-function-based
  method, and it supports various kinds of density models, including custom-tabulated
  inputs and the presence of more than one disc. We tested the dynamical stability
  of systems generated by our code, representing early- and late-type galaxies, with
  N = 2097 152 and 8388 608 particles, respectively, and we found that the model galaxies
  maintain their initial distributions for at least 1 Gyr. The execution times required
  to generate the two models were 8.5 and 221.7 seconds, respectively, which is negligible
  compared to typical execution times for N-body simulations. The code is provided
  as open-source software and is publicly and freely available at https://bitbucket.org/ymiki/magi.
