abstract: We report the finding of kiloparsec (kpc)-scale radio structures in three
  radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies from the Faint Images of the Radio
  Sky at Twenty-centimeters of the Very Large Array, which increases the number of
  known radio-loud NLS1s with kpc-scale structures to six, including two \ensuremathγ-ray-emitting
  NLS1s (PMN J0948+0022 and 1H 0323+342) detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.
  The detection rate of extended radio emissions in NLS1s is lower than that in broad-line
  active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with a statistical significance. We found both core-dominated
  (blazar- like) and lobe-dominated (radio-galaxy-like) radio structures in these
  six NLS1s, which can be understood in the framework of the unified scheme of radio-loud
  AGNs that considers radio galaxies as non-beamed parent populations of blazars.
  Five of the six NLS1s have (1) extended radio luminosities suggesting jet kinetic
  powers of &gt;åisebox-0.5ex~ 10$^44$ erg s$^-1$, which is sufficient to make jets
  escape from hosts' dense environments; (2) black holes of &gt;\i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 10$^7$
  M $_☉$, which can generate the necessary jet powers from near-Eddington mass accretion;
  and (3) two-sided radio structures at kpc scales, requiring expansion rates of \rs̊ebox-0.5ex~0.01c-0.3c
  and kinematic ages of &gt;\rae̊box-0.5ex~ 10$^7$ years. On the other hand, most
  typical NLS1s would be driven by black holes of &lt;\raib̊ox-0.5ex~ 10$^7$ M $_☉$
  in a limited lifetime of \raiso̊x-0.5ex~10$^7$ years. Hence, the kpc-scale radio
  structures may originate in a small window of opportunity during the final stage
  of the NLS1 phase just before growing into broad-line AGNs.
