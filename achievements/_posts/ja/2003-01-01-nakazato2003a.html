abstract: A new method that enables us to estimate the inclination of Class I young
  stellar objects is proposed. Since Class I objects are not spherically symmetric,
  it is likely that the observed feature is sensitive to the inclination of the system.
  Thus, we construct a protostar model by carefully treating two-dimensional radiative
  transfer and radiative equilibrium. We show from the present two-dimensional numerical
  simulations that the emergent luminosity L$_SED$, which is the frequency integration
  of spectral energy distribution (SED), depends strongly on the inclination of the
  system i, whereas the peak flux is insensitive to i. Based on this result, we introduce
  a novel indicator f$_L$, which is the ratio of L$_SED$ to the peak flux, as a good
  measure for the inclination. By using f$_L$, we can determine the inclination regardless
  of the other physical parameters. The inclination would be determined by f$_L$ within
  an accuracy of +/-5Â° if the opening angle of bipolar outflows is specified by any
  other procedure. Since this spectrophotometric method is easier than a geometrical
  method or a full SED fitting method, it could be a powerful tool for investigating
  the features of protostars statistically with observational data that will be provided
  by future missions, such as SIRTF, Astro-F, and ALMA.
