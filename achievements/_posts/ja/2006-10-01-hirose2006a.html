abstract: We propose a novel method of extracting the imprint of gravitational lensing
  by Population III stars in the light curves of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Significant
  portions of GRBs can originate in hypernovae of Population III stars and be gravitationally
  lensed by foreground Population III stars or their remnants. If the lens mass is
  on the order of 10$^2$-10$^3$ M$_solar$ and the lens redshift is greater than 10,
  the time delay between two lensed images of a GRB is åisebox-0.5ex~1 s and the image
  separation is \i̊sebox-0.5ex~10 \ensuremathμas. Although it is difficult to resolve
  the two lensed images spatially with current facilities, the light curves of the
  two images are superimposed with a delay of \rs̊ebox-0.5ex~1 s. GRB light curves
  usually exhibit noticeable variability, where each spike is less than 1 s. If a
  GRB is lensed, all spikes are superimposed with the same time delay. Hence, if the
  autocorrelation of the light curve with changing time interval is calculated, it
  should show resonance at the time delay of the lensed images. Applying this autocorrelation
  method to GRB light curves that are archived as the BATSE catalog, we demonstrate
  that more than half of the light curves show recognizable resonance they are lensed.
  Furthermore, in 1821 GRBs we actually find one candidate for a GRB lensed by a Population
  III star, which may be located at redshift 20-200. The present method is quite straightforward
  and therefore provides an effective tool for searching for Population III stars
  at redshift greater than 10. Using this method, we may find more candidates for
  GRBs lensed by Population III stars in the data of the Swift satellite.
