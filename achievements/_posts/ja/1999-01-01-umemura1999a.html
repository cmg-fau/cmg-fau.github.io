abstract: We present a radiative/hydrodynamical mechanism for triggering AGN activity;
  the intensive radiation from a circumnuclear starburst drives the nuclear fueling
  due to the Poynting-Robertson (radiation drag) effects. When the starburst is in
  an early and therefore super-Eddington phase, the radiative flux force is likely
  to obstruct severely the mass accretion onto the nucleus (radiative blizzard phase).
  But, in a later sub-Eddington phase, the radiation flux force builds up a wall of
  dusty gas. The wall absorbs the radiation from the starburst regions and re-emits
  infrared radiation, which causes the disk accretion due to the Poynting-Robertson
  effect, consequently leading to nuclear fueling (radiative avalanche phase). The
  radiative avalanche could link to an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) onto
  a putative supermassive black hole. The radiatively triggered nuclear activity diminishes
  as the starburst dims. In this context, the AGN type could be discriminated not
  only by the viewing angles but also by the evolution of a circumnuclear starbursts.
  Based on such a picture, we reconsider the AGN activity in luminous IRAS galaxies.
