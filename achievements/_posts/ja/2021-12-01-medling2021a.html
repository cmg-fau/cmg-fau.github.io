<p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >We study the ionization and excitation structure of the interstellar medium in the late-stage
gas-rich galaxy merger NGC 6240 using a suite of emission-line maps at ~25 pc resolution
from the Hubble Space Telescope, Keck/NIRC2 with Adaptive Optics, and the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). NGC 6240 hosts a superwind driven by
intense star formation and/or one or both of two active nuclei; the outflows produce bubbles
and filaments seen in shock tracers from warm molecular gas (H<sub><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">2</span></sub> 2.12 <span 
class="txmi-">μ</span>m) to optical ionized
gas ([O III], [N II], [S II], and [O I]) and hot plasma (Fe XXV). In the most distinct
bubble, we see a clear shock front traced by high [O III]/H<span 
class="txmi-">β </span>and [O III]/[O I]. Cool
molecular gas (CO(2-1)) is only present near the base of the bubble, toward the nuclei
launching the outflow. We interpret the lack of molecular gas outside the bubble to
mean that the shock front is not responsible for dissociating molecular gas, and
conclude that the molecular clouds are partly shielded and either entrained briefly in
the outflow, or left undisturbed while the hot wind flows around them. Elsewhere
in the galaxy, shock- excited H<sub><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">2</span></sub> extends at least ~4 kpc from the nuclei, tracing
molecular gas even warmer than that between the nuclei, where the two galaxies&#8217;
interstellar media are colliding. A ridgeline of high [O III]/H<span 
class="txmi-">β </span>emission along the eastern
arm aligns with the southern nucleus&#8217; stellar disk minor axis; optical integral field
spectroscopy from WiFeS suggests this highly ionized gas is centered at systemic
velocity and likely photoionized by direct line of sight to the southern active galactic
nucleus.</p>
