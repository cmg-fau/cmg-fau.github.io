abstract: Transitional disks show a lack of excess emission at infrared wavelengths
  due to a large dust cavity, that is often corroborated by spatially resolved observations
  at ̃ mm wavelengths. We present the first spatially resolved ̃ mm- wavelength images
  of the disk around the Herbig Ae/Be star, HD 97048. Scattered light images show
  that the disk extends to \ensuremath≈640 au. ALMA data reveal a circular- symmetric
  dusty disk extending to \ensuremath≈350 au, and a molecular disk traced in CO J
  = 3-2 emission, extending to \ensuremath≈750 au. The CO emission arises from a flared
  layer with an opening angle \ensuremath≈30°-40°. HD 97048 is another source for
  which the large (̃ mm-sized) dust grains are more centrally concentrated than the
  small (̃\ensuremathμm-sized) grains and molecular gas, likely due to radial drift.
  The images and visibility data modeling suggest a decrement in continuum emission
  within \ensuremath≈50 au, consistent with the cavity size determined from mid-infrared
  imaging (34 \ensuremath± 4 au). The extracted continuum intensity profiles show
  ring-like structures with peaks at \ensuremath≈50, 150, and 300 au, with associated
  gaps at \ensuremath≈100 and 250 au. This structure should be confirmed in higher-resolution
  images (FWHM \ensuremath≈ 10-20 au). These data confirm the classification of HD
  97048 as a transitional disk that also possesses multiple ring-like structures in
  the dust continuum emission. Additional data are required at multiple and well-separated
  frequencies to fully characterize the disk structure, and thereby constrain the
  mechanism(s) responsible for sculpting the HD 97048 disk.
