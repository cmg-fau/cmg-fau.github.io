abstract: We have observed complex organic molecules (COMs) and deuterated species
  toward a hot core/corino (HC) associated with the infrared dark cloud clump G34.43+00.24
  MM3 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We have detected six
  normal-COMs (CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$CH$_2$CN, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, HCOOCH$_3$, and
  NH$_2$CHO), one deuterated-COM (CH$_2$DCN), and two deuterated fundamental molecules
  (D$_2$CO and DNC) toward G34.43+00.24 MM3 HC. None of these lines, except for CH$_3$OH,
  are detected toward the shocked regions in our data, which suggests that COMs do
  not originate in shocks. The abundance of the COMs relative to CH$_3$OH in G34.43+00.24
  MM3 HC is found to be similar to those in high-mass hot cores, rather than those
  in hot corinos in low-mass star- forming regions. This result suggests that the
  physical conditions of the warm-up phase of G34.43+00.24 MM3 HC are similar to those
  of high-mass sources. On the other hand, the D$_2$CO abundance relative to CH$_3$OH
  in G34.43+00.24 MM3 HC is higher than that of other hot cores, and seems to be comparable
  to that of hot corinos. The relatively high D$_2$CO/CH$_3$OH ratio of G34.43+00.24
  MM3 HC implies a long cold starless phase of G34.43+00.24 MM3 HC.
