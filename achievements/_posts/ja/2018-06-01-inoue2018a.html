abstract: The survey of Lyman \ensuremathα emitters (LAEs) with the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam,
  called SILVERRUSH (Ouchi et al. 2018, PASJ, 70, S13), is producing massive data
  of LAEs at z \ensuremath\gtrsim 6. Here we present LAE simulations to compare the
  SILVERRUSH data. In 162$^3$ comoving Mpc$^3$ boxes, where numerical radiative transfer
  calculations of reionization were performed, LAEs have been modeled with physically
  motivated analytic recipes as a function of halo mass. We have examined 2$^3$ models
  depending on the presence or absence of dispersion of halo Ly\ensuremathα emissivity,
  dispersion of the halo Ly\ensuremathα optical depth, \ensuremathτ$_\ensuremathα$,
  and halo mass dependence of \ensuremathτ$_\ensuremathα$. The unique free parameter
  in our model, a pivot value of \ensuremathτ$_\ensuremathα$, is calibrated so as
  to reproduce the z = 5.7 Ly\ensuremathα luminosity function (LF) of SILVERRUSH.
  We compare our model predictions with Ly\ensuremathα LFs at z = 6.6 and 7.3, LAE
  angular auto-correlation functions (ACFs) at z = 5.7 and 6.6, and LAE fractions
  in Lyman break galaxies at 5 &lt; z &lt; 7. The Ly\ensuremathα LFs and ACFs are
  reproduced by multiple models, but the LAE fraction turns out to be the most critical
  test. The dispersion of \ensuremathτ$_\ensuremathα$ and the halo mass dependence
  of \ensuremathτ$_\ensuremathα$ are essential to explain all observations reasonably.
  Therefore, a simple model of one-to-one correspondence between halo mass and Ly\ensuremathα
  luminosity with a constant Ly\ensuremathα escape fraction has been ruled out. Based
  on our best model, we present a formula to estimate the intergalactic neutral hydrogen
  fraction, x_\H I\, from the observed Ly\ensuremathα luminosity density at z \ensuremath\gtrsim
  6. We finally obtain x_\H I\=0.5_\-0.3\\̂+0.1\ as a volume-average at z = 7.3. <P
