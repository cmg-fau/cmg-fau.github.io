abstract: We investigate nitrogen-isotope fractionation in forming and evolving molecular
  clouds using gas-ice astrochemical simulations. We find that the bulk gas can become
  depleted in heavy nitrogen ($^15$N) due to the formation of $^15$N-enriched ices.
  Around the chemical transition from atomic nitrogen to N$_2$, N$^15$N is selectively
  photodissociated, which results in the enrichment of $^15$N in atomic nitrogen.
  As $^15$N-enriched atomic nitrogen is converted to ammonia ice via grain surface
  reactions, the bulk gas is depleted in $^15$N. The level of $^15$N depletion in
  the bulk gas can be up to a factor of two compared to the elemental nitrogen-isotope
  ratio, depending on the photodesorption yield of ammonia ice. Once the nitrogen
  isotopes are differentially partitioned between gas and solids in a molecular cloud,
  the condition should remain in the later stages of star formation (e.g., prestellar
  core) as long as the sublimation of ammonia ice is inefficient. Our model suggests
  that all of the N-bearing molecules in the cold gas of star- forming regions can
  be depleted in $^15$N, which is at least qualitatively consistent with the observations
  toward prestellar core L1544. In our models, icy species show both $^15$N and deuterium
  fractionation. The fractionation pattern within ice mantles is different between
  $^15$N and deuterium, reflecting their fractionation mechanisms; while the concentration
  of deuterium almost monotonically increases from the lower layers of the ice mantles
  to the upper layers, the concentration of $^15$N reaches the maximum at a certain
  depth and declines toward the surface.
