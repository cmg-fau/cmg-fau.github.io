abstract: 'Recent interferometer observations have found that the D$_2$O/HDO abundance
  ratio is higher than that of HDO/H$_2$O by about one order of magnitude in the vicinity
  of low-mass protostar NGC 1333-IRAS 2A, where water ice has sublimated. Previous
  laboratory and theoretical studies show that the D$_2$O/HDO ice ratio should be
  lower than the HDO/H$_2$O ice ratio, if HDO and D$_2$O ices are formed simultaneously
  with H$_2$O ice. In this work, we propose that the observed feature, D$_2$O/HDO
  &gt; HDO/H$_2$O, is a natural consequence of chemical evolution in the early cold
  stages of low-mass star formation as follows: 1) majority of oxygen is locked up
  in water ice and other molecules in molecular clouds, where water deuteration is
  not efficient; and 2) water ice formation continues with much reduced efficiency
  in cold prestellar/protostellar cores, where deuteration processes are highly enhanced
  as a result of the drop of the ortho-para ratio of H$_2$, the weaker UV radiation
  field, etc. Using a simple analytical model and gas-ice astrochemical simulations,
  which traces the evolution from the formation of molecular clouds to protostellar
  cores, we show that the proposed scenario can quantitatively explain the observed
  HDO/H$_2$O and D$_2$O/HDO ratios. We also find that the majority of HDO and D$_2$O
  ices are likely formed in cold prestellar/protostellar cores rather than in molecular
  clouds, where the majority of H$_2$O ice is formed. This work demonstrates the power
  of the combination of the HDO/H$_2$O and D$_2$O/HDO ratios as a tool to reveal the
  past history of water ice formation in the early cold stages of star formation,
  and when the enrichment of deuterium in the bulk of water occurred. Further observations
  are needed to explore if the relation, D$_2$O/HDO &gt; HDO/H$_2$O, is common in
  low-mass protostellar sources.'
