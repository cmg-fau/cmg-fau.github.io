abstract: Hydrodynamical simulations predict that the jets of young radio sources
  can inhibit star formation in their host galaxies by injecting heat and turbulence
  into the interstellar medium (ISM). To investigate jet-ISM interactions in a galaxy
  with a young radio source, we have carried out a multiwavelength study of the z
  = 0.025 Compact Steep Spectrum radio source hosted by the early- type galaxy UGC
  05771. Using Keck/OSIRIS observations, we detected H$_2$ 1-0 S(1) and [Fe II] emission
  at radii of 100s of parsecs, which traces shocked molecular and ionized gas being
  accelerated outwards by the jets to low velocities, creating a `stalling wind'.
  At kpc radii, we detected shocked ionized gas using observations from the CALIFA
  survey, covering an area much larger than the pc-scale radio source. We found that
  existing interferometric radio observations fail to recover a large fraction of
  the source's total flux, indicating the likely existence of jet plasma on kpc scales,
  which is consistent with the extent of shocked gas in the host galaxy. To investigate
  the star formation efficiency in UGC 05771, we obtained IRAM CO observations to
  analyse the molecular gas properties. We found that UGC 05771 sits below the Kennicutt-Schmidt
  relation, although we were unable to definitively conclude if direct interactions
  from the jets are inhibiting star formation. This result shows that jets may be
  important in regulating star formation in the host galaxies of compact radio sources.
