abstract: Ultra-high resolution hydrodynamic simulations using 1024$^3$ grid points
  are performed of early supernova burst in a forming galaxy, with properties similar
  to those inferred for Lyman \ensuremathα emitters (LAEs) and Lyman Break Galaxies
  (LBGs). We show that, at the earliest stages of less than 300 Myr, continual supernova
  explosions produce multitudinous hot bubbles and cooled H(I) shells in-between.
  The H(I) shells radiate intense Lyman \ensuremathα (Ly \ensuremathα) emission like
  LAEs. We found that the bubbly structures produced are quite similar to the observed
  features in the Ly \ensuremathα surface brightness distribution of the extended
  LAEs. After 1 Gyr, the galaxies are dominated by stellar continuum radiation and
  then resemble the LBGs. At this point, the abundance of heavy elements appears to
  be solar. After 13 Gyr, these galaxies resemble present-day ellipticals. <P />
