abstract: 'Stereoscopic visualization is seldom used in Astrophysical publications
  and presentations compared to other scientific fields, e.g., Biochemistry, where
  it has been recognized as a valuable tool for decades. We put forth the view that
  stereo pairs can be a useful tool for the Astrophysics community in communicating
  a truer representation of astrophysical data. Here, we review the main theoretical
  aspects of stereoscopy, and present a tutorial to easily create stereo pairs using
  Python. We then describe how stereo pairs provide a way to incorporate 3D data in
  2D publications of standard journals. We illustrate the use of stereo pairs with
  one conceptual and two Astrophysical science examples: an integral field spectroscopy
  study of a supernova remnant, and numerical simulations of a relativistic AGN jet.
  We also use these examples to make the case that stereo pairs are not merely an
  ostentatious way to present data, but an enhancement in the communication of scientific
  results in publications because they provide the reader with a realistic view of
  multi-dimensional data, be it of observational or theoretical nature. In recognition
  of the ongoing 3D expansion in the commercial sector, we advocate an increased use
  of stereo pairs in Astrophysics publications and presentations as a first step towards
  new interactive and multi-dimensional publication methods. <P />'
