abstract: Motivated by a recently found interesting property of the dark halo surface
  density within a radius, \r\$_\max $, giving the maximum circular velocity, \V\$_\max
  $, we investigate it for dark halos of the Milky Way\textquoterights and Andromeda\textquoterights
  dwarf satellites based on cosmological simulations. We select and analyze the simulated
  subhalos associated with Milky-Way-sized dark halos and find that the values of
  their surface densities, \\\\ensuremathΣ \\\$_\V$$_\max $\, are in good agreement
  with those for the observed dwarf spheroidal satellites even without employing any
  fitting procedures. Moreover, all subhalos on the small scales of dwarf satellites
  are expected to obey the universal relation, irrespective of differences in their
  orbital evolutions, host halo properties, and observed redshifts. Therefore, we
  find that the universal scaling relation for dark halos on dwarf galaxy mass scales
  surely exists and provides us with important clues for understanding fundamental
  properties of dark halos. We also investigate orbital and dynamical evolutions of
  subhalos to understand the origin of this universal dark halo relation and find
  that most subhalos evolve generally along the \r\$_\max $∝ \V\$_\max $ sequence,
  even though these subhalos have undergone different histories of mass assembly and
  tidal stripping. This sequence, therefore, should be the key feature for understanding
  the nature of the universality of \\\\ensuremathΣ \\\$_\V$$_\max $\.
