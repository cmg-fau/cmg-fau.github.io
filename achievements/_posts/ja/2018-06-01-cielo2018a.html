abstract: Feedback by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is often divided into quasar and
  radio mode, powered by radiation or radio jets, respectively. Both are fundamental
  in galaxy evolution, especially in late-type galaxies, as shown by cosmological
  simulations and observations of jet-ISM (interstellar medium) interactions in these
  systems. We compare AGN feedback by radiation and by collimated jets through a suite
  of simulations, in which a central AGN interacts with a clumpy, fractal galactic
  disc. We test AGNs of 10$^43$ and 10$^46$ erg s$^-1$, considering jets perpendicular
  or parallel to the disc. Mechanical jets drive the more powerful outflows, exhibiting
  stronger mass and momentum coupling with the dense gas, while radiation heats and
  rarefies the gas more. Radiation and perpendicular jets evolve to be quite similar
  in outflow properties and effect on the cold ISM, while inclined jets interact more
  efficiently with all the disc gas, removing the densest 20 \per cent\ in 20 Myr,
  and thereby reducing the amount of cold gas available for star formation. All simulations
  show small-scale inflows of 0.01-0.1 M$_â˜‰$ yr$^-1$, which can easily reach down
  to the Bondi radius of the central supermassive black hole (especially for radiation
  and perpendicular jets), implying that AGNs modulate their own duty cycle in a feedback/feeding
  cycle.
