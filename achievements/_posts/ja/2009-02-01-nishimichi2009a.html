abstract: We used a series of cosmological N-body simulations and various analytic
  models to study the evolution of the matter power spectrum in real space in a \ensuremathŁambda
  cold dark matter universe. We compared the results of N-body simulations against
  three analytical model predictions; standard perturbation theory, renormalized perturbation
  theory, and a closure approximation. We included the effects from a finite simulation
  box size under comparison. We determined the values of the maximum wavenumbers,
  k$^lim$$_1%$ and k$^lim$$_3%$, below which the analytic models and the simulation
  results agree with accuracy to within 1 and 3 percent. We then provided a simple
  empirical function that describes the convergence regime determined by comparisons
  between our simulations and the analytical models. We found that if we use the Fourier
  modes within the convergence regime alone, the characteristic scale of baryon acoustic
  oscillations can be determined with an accuracy of 1% from future surveys with a
  volume of a few h$^-3$Gpc$^3$ at z ̃ 1 or z ̃ 3 in the absence of any systematic
  distortion of the power spectrum.
