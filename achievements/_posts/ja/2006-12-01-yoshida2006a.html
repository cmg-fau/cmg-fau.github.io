abstract: 'We investigate the luminosity functions of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs)
  at zåisebox-0.5ex~4 and z\i̊sebox-0.5ex~5 based on optical imaging data obtained
  in the Subaru Deep Field project. Three samples of LBGs in a contiguous area of
  875 arcmin$^2$ are constructed. One consists of 3808 LBGs at z\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~4 down
  to i''=26.85 selected with the B-R versus R-i'' diagram. The other two consist of
  539 and 240 LBGs at z\rae̊box-0.5ex~5 down to z''=26.05 selected with two kinds
  of two-color diagram: V-i'' versus i''-z'' and R-i'' versus i''-z''. The adopted
  selection criteria are proved to be fairly reliable by spectroscopic observations.
  We derive the luminosity functions of the LBGs at rest-frame ultraviolet wavelengths
  down to M$_UV$=-19.2 at z\raib̊ox-0.5ex~4 and M$_UV$=-20.3 at z\raiso̊x-0.5ex~5.
  We find clear evolution of the luminosity function over the redshift range 0&lt;=z&lt;=6,
  which is accounted for solely by a change in the characteristic magnitude M$^*$.
  We examine the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) density and its
  luminosity dependence over 0&lt;=z&lt;\raisex̊-0.5ex~6. The SFR density contributed
  from brighter galaxies is found to change more drastically with cosmic time. The
  contribution from brighter galaxies has a sharp peak around z=3-4, while that from
  fainter galaxies evolves relatively mildly with a broad peak at earlier epochs.
  Combining the observed SFR density with the standard cold dark matter model, we
  compute the cosmic SFR per unit baryon mass in dark halos, that is, the specific
  SFR. The specific SFR is found to scale with redshift as (1+z)$^3$ up to z\raiseb̊-0.5ex~4,
  implying that the efficiency of star formation is on average higher at higher redshift
  in proportion to the cooling rate within dark halos, while this is not simply the
  case at z&gt;\raisebo-̊0.5ex~4. <P />Based on data collected at the Subaru Telescope,
  which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.'
