abstract: 'The chemical history of carbon is traced from its origin in stellar nucleosynthesis
  to its delivery to planet surfaces. The molecular carriers of this element are examined
  at each stage in the cycling of interstellar organic material and their eventual
  incorporation into solar system bodies. The connection between the various interstellar
  carbon reservoirs is also examined. Carbon has two stellar sources: supernova explosions
  and mass loss from evolved stars. In the latter case, the carbon is dredged up from
  the interior and then ejected into a circumstellar envelope, where a rich and unusual
  C-based chemistry occurs. This molecular material is eventually released into the
  general interstellar medium through planetary nebulae. It is first incorporated
  into diffuse clouds, where carbon is found in polyatomic molecules such as H$_2$CO,
  HCN, HNC, c-C$_3$H$_2$, and even C$_60$$^+$. These objects then collapse into dense
  clouds, the sites of star and planet formation. Such clouds foster an active organic
  chemistry, producing compounds with a wide range of functional groups with both
  gas-phase and surface mechanisms. As stars and planets form, the chemical composition
  is altered by increasing stellar radiation, as well as possibly by reactions in
  the presolar nebula. Some molecular, carbon-rich material remains pristine, however,
  encapsulated in comets, meteorites, and interplanetary dust particles, and is delivered
  to planet surfaces. <P />'
