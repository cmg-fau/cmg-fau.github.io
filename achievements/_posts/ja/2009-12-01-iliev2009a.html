abstract: 'The development of radiation hydrodynamical methods that are able to follow
  gas dynamics and radiative transfer (RT) self- consistently is key to the solution
  of many problems in numerical astrophysics. Such fluid flows are highly complex,
  rarely allowing even for approximate analytical solutions against which numerical
  codes can be tested. An alternative validation procedure is to compare different
  methods against each other on common problems, in order to assess the robustness
  of the results and establish a range of validity for the methods. Previously, we
  presented such a comparison for a set of pure RT tests (i.e. for fixed, non-evolving
  density fields). This is the second paper of the Cosmological Radiative Transfer
  Comparison Project, in which we compare nine independent RT codes directly coupled
  to gas dynamics on three relatively simple astrophysical hydrodynamics problems:
  (i) the expansion of an HII region in a uniform medium, (ii) an ionization front
  in a 1/r$^2$ density profile with a flat core and (iii) the photoevaporation of
  a uniform dense clump. Results show a broad agreement between the different methods
  and no big failures, indicating that the participating codes have reached a certain
  level of maturity and reliability. However, many details still do differ, and virtually
  every code has showed some shortcomings and has disagreed, in one respect or another,
  with the majority of the results. This underscores the fact that no method is universal
  and all require careful testing of the particular features which are most relevant
  to the specific problem at hand. <P />'
