abstract: Using two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate
  the origin of the ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) that are often observed in luminous
  active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We found that the radiation force due to the spectral
  lines generates strong winds (line-driven disk winds) that are launched from the
  inner region of accretion disks (̃30 Schwarzschild radii). A wide range of black
  hole masses (M$_BH$) and Eddington ratios (\ensuremathɛ) was investigated to study
  the conditions causing the line-driven winds. For M$_BH$ = 10$^6$-10$^9$ M$_☉$ and
  \ensuremathɛ = 0.1-0.7, funnel-shaped disk winds appear, in which dense matter is
  accelerated outward with an opening angle of 70°-80° and with 10% of the speed of
  light. If we observe the wind along its direction, the velocity, the column density,
  and the ionization state are consistent with those of the observed UFOs. As long
  as obscuration by the torus does not affect the observation of X-ray bands, the
  UFOs could be statistically observed in about 13%-28% of the luminous AGNs, which
  is not inconsistent with the observed ratio (̃40%). We also found that the results
  are insensitive to the X-ray luminosity and the density of the disk surface. Thus,
  we can conclude that UFOs could exist in any luminous AGNs, such as narrow-line
  Seyfert 1s and quasars with \ensuremathɛ &gt; 0.1, with which fast line- driven
  winds are associated.
