abstract: We study the formation of very metal-poor stars under protostellar radiative
  feedback effect. We use cosmological simulations to identify low-mass dark matter
  haloes and star-forming gas clouds within them. We then follow protostar formation
  and the subsequent long-term mass accretion phase of over one million years using
  two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. We show that the critical physical
  process that sets the final mass is the formation and expansion of a bipolar H II
  region. The process is similar to the formation of massive primordial stars, but
  radiation pressure exerted on dust grains also contributes to halting the accretion
  flow in the low-metallicity case. We find that the net feedback effect in the case
  with metallicity Z = 10$^-2$ Z$_☉$ is stronger than in the case with Z \ensuremath∼
  1 Z$_☉$. With decreasing metallicity, the radiation-pressure effect becomes weaker,
  but photoionization heating of the circumstellar gas is more efficient owing to
  the reduced dust attenuation. In the case with Z = 10$^-2$ Z$_☉$, the central star
  grows as massive as 200 solar masses, similarly to the case of primordial star formation.
  We conclude that metal-poor stars with a few hundred solar masses can be formed
  by gas accretion despite the strong radiative feedback.
