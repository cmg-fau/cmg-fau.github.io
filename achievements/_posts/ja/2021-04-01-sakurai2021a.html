<p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >Planetesimals are believed to be formed by the coagulation of dust grains in the
protoplanetary disk turbulence. However, the bouncing and fragmentation barriers have not
been completely solved, particularly for silicate dust. To circumvent these barriers, the
turbulent clustering of dust particles must be properly treated. According to the
minimum-mass solar nebula (MMSN) model, the Mach number of the turbulence ranges
from M<sub><span 
class="txmi-x-x-74">rms</span></sub> <span 
class="txsy-">≈ </span>0.01-0.32, and thus the turbulence is often regarded as essentially
incompressible. However, it has not been quantitatively investigated whether the
incompressible limit is adequate for protoplanetary disk simulations. We therefore compare
in this study the motions of inertial particles in direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of the
Navier-Stokes equation between weakly compressible turbulence and incompressible
turbulence. In the DNSs of compressible turbulence, we use an external force to set the total
dissipation and the dilatational-to-solenoidal dissipation ratio. The DNSs reveal that despite
the small Mach number M<sub><span 
class="txmi-x-x-74">rms</span></sub>( <span 
class="txsya-">≲ </span>0.3), the compressible turbulence field notably differs from
the incompressible field in terms of the density fluctuations, pressure fluctuations, and
shocklet generation, depending on the ratio of the dilatational forcing. However, we
quantitatively confirmed that these effects on the particle collision statistics are
weak and that the motion of inertial particles in weakly compressible turbulence
is dominated by the solenoidal velocity components. Therefore we can conclude
that the incompressible assumption is appropriate for an investigation of the dust
coagulation process in protoplanetary disk turbulence, as assumed in the MMSN
model.</p>
