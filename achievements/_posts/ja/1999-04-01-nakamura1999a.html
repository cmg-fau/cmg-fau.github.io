abstract: Performing one-dimensional hydrodynamical calculations coupled with nonequilibrium
  processes for hydrogen molecule formation, we pursue the thermal and dynamical evolution
  of filamentary primordial gas clouds and attempt to make an estimate on the mass
  of Population III stars. The cloud evolution is computed from the central proton
  density n$_c$åisebox-0.5ex~10$^2$-10$^4$ cm$^-3$ up to \i̊sebox-0.5ex~10$^13$ cm$^-3$.
  It is found that, almost independent of initial conditions, a filamentary cloud
  continues to collapse nearly isothermally owing to H$_2$ cooling until the cloud
  becomes optically thick against the H$_2$ lines (n$_c$\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~10$^10$-10$^11$
  cm$^-3$). During the collapse the cloud structure separates into two parts, i.e.,
  a denser spindle and a diffuse envelope. The spindle contracts quasi-statically,
  and thus the line mass of the spindle keeps a characteristic value determined solely
  by the temperature (\rae̊box-0.5ex~800 K), which is \raib̊ox-0.5ex~1×10$^3$ M$_solar$
  pc$^-1$ during the contraction from n$_c$\raiso̊x-0.5ex~10$^5$ cm$^-3$ to 10$^13$
  cm$^-3$. Applying a linear theory, we find that the spindle is unstable against
  fragmentation during the collapse. The wavelength of the fastest growing perturbation
  (\ensuremathłambda$_m$) lessens as the collapse proceeds. Consequently, successive
  fragmentation could occur. When the central density exceeds n$_c$\raisex̊-0.5ex~10$^10$-10$^11$
  cm$^-3$, the successive fragmentation may cease, since the cloud becomes opaque
  against the H$_2$ lines and the collapse decelerates appreciably. Resultantly, the
  minimum value of \ensuremathłambda$_m$ is estimated to be \raiseb̊-0.5ex~2×10$^-3$
  pc. The mass of the first star is then expected to be typically \raisebo-̊0.5ex~3
  M$_solar$, which may grow up to \raisebox0̊.5ex~16 M$_solar$ by accreting the diffuse
  envelope. Thus, the first-generation stars are anticipated to be massive but not
  supermassive.
