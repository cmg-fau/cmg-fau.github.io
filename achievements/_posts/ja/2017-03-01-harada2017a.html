abstract: Recent observations suggested that the growth of dust grains may have already
  occurred in class 0/I young stellar objects (YSOs). Since chemical reactions on
  dust grain surfaces are important in determining molecular abundances, the dust
  size growth may affect chemical compositions in YSOs significantly. In this work,
  we aim to determine how grain growth affects chemical abundances. We use a time-dependent
  gas-grain chemical model for a star-forming core to calculate the gas-phase and
  grain-surface chemical abundances with variation of surface areas of grains to imitate
  grain growth. We also perform parameter studies in which the initial molecular abundances
  vary. Our results show that a smaller extent of the surface areas caused by grain
  growth changes the dominant form of sulfur-bearing molecules by decreasing H$_2$S
  abundances and increasing SO and/or SO$_2$ abundances. We also find that complex
  organic molecules such as CH$_3$CN decrease in abundances with larger grain sizes,
  while the abundance of other species such as CH$_3$OCH$_3$ is dependent on other
  parameters such as the initial conditions. Comparisons with observations of a class
  0 protostar, IRAS 16293-2422, indicate that the observed abundance ratios between
  sulfur-bearing molecules H$_2$S, SO, and SO$_2$ can be reproduced very well when
  dust grains grow to a maximum grain size of a $_max$ = 10-100 \ensuremathÎ¼m.
