abstract: Pre-stellar cores represent the initial conditions in the process of star
  and planet formation, therefore it is important to study their physical and chemical
  structure. Because of their volatility, nitrogen-bearing molecules are key to study
  the dense and cold gas present in pre-stellar cores. The NH$_3$ rotational transition
  detected with Herschel-HIFI provides a unique combination of sensitivity and spectral
  resolution to further investigate physical and chemical processes in pre- stellar
  cores. Here we present the velocity-resolved Herschel- HIFI observations of the
  ortho-NH$_3$(1$_0$ - 0$_0$) line at 572 GHz and study the abundance profile of ammonia
  across the pre-stellar core L1544 to test current theories of its physical and chemical
  structure. Recently calculated collisional coefficients have been included in our
  non-LTE radiative transfer code to reproduce Herschel observations. A gas-grain
  chemical model, including spin-state chemistry and applied to the (static) physical
  structure of L1544 is also used to infer the abundance profile of ortho-NH$_3$.
  The hyperfine structure of ortho-NH$_3$(1$_0$ - 0$_0$) is resolved for the first
  time in space. All the hyperfine components are strongly self-absorbed. The profile
  can be reproduced if the core is contracting in quasi-equilibrium, consistent with
  previous work, and if the NH$_3$ abundance is slightly rising toward the core centre,
  as deduced from previous interferometric observations of para-NH$_3$(1, 1). The
  chemical model overestimates the NH$_3$ abundance at radii between ≃4000 and 15
  000 AU by about two orders of magnitude and underestimates the abundance toward
  the core centre by more than one order of magnitude. Our observations show that
  chemical models applied to static clouds have problems in reproducing NH$_3$ observations.

  science instruments provided by a European-led Principal Investigator consortium
  and with important participation from NASA.
