abstract: 'We report the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) discovery of two Ly\ensuremathα
  blobs (LABs), dubbed z70-1 and z49-1 at z = 6.965 and z = 4.888, respectively, that
  are Ly\ensuremathα emitters with a bright (log\L\$_Ly\ensuremathα$/[erg s$^-1$]$\gt$
  43.4) and spatially extended Ly\ensuremathα emission, and present the photometric
  and spectroscopic properties of a total of seven LABs: the two new LABs and five
  previously known LABs at z = 5.7-6.6. The z70-1 LAB shows extended Ly\ensuremathα
  emission with a scale length of 1.4 \ensuremath± 0.2 kpc, about three times larger
  than the UV continuum emission, making z70-1 the most distant LAB identified to
  date. All of the seven LABs, except z49-1, exhibit no active galactic nucleus (AGN)
  signatures such as X-ray emission, N V \ensuremathłambda1240 emission, or Ly\ensuremathα
  line broadening, while z49-1 has a strong C IV \ensuremathłambda1548 emission line
  indicating an AGN on the basis of the UV-line ratio diagnostics. We carefully model
  the point-spread functions of the HSC images and conduct two- component exponential
  profile fitting to the extended Ly\ensuremathα emission of the LABs. The Ly\ensuremathα
  scale lengths of the core (star-forming region) and halo components are r$_c$ =
  0.6-1.2 kpc and r$_h$ = 2.0-13.8 kpc, respectively. The relations between the scale
  lengths and galaxy properties (Ly\ensuremathα luminosity L$_Ly\ensuremathα$, Ly\ensuremathα
  rest-frame equivalent width EW$_0$, and UV continuum magnitude M$_UV$) of our LABs
  are similar to those of Ly\ensuremathα halos (LAHs) identified around star-forming
  galaxies found previously by the Very Large Telescope/MUSE at similar redshifts,
  suggesting that our LABs are likely the bright version of high-z LAHs.'
