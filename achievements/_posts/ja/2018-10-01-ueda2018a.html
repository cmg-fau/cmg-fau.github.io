abstract: RX J1347.5-1145 (z = 0.451) is one of the most luminous X-ray galaxy clusters;
  it hosts a prominent cool core and exhibits a signature of a major merger. We present
  the first direct observational evidence for the subsonic nature of the sloshing
  motion of the cool core. We find that a residual X-ray image from the Chandra X-ray
  Observatory after removing the global emission shows a clear dipolar pattern characteristic
  of gas sloshing, whereas we find no significant residual in the Sunyaev-Zel\textquoterightdovich
  effect (SZE) image from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).
  We estimate the equation of state of perturbations in the gas from the X-ray and
  SZE residual images. The inferred velocity is \420\$_-420$$^+310$ km s$^-1$, which
  is much lower than the adiabatic sound speed of the intracluster medium in the core.
  We thus conclude that the perturbation is nearly isobaric, and the gas sloshing
  motion is consistent with being in pressure equilibrium. Next, we report evidence
  for gas stripping of an infalling subcluster, which likely shock-heats the gas to
  a temperature well in excess of 20 keV. Using the mass distribution inferred from
  strong lensing images of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we find that the mass
  peak is located away from the peak position of the stripped gas with a statistical
  significance of &gt;5\ensuremathσ. Unlike for the gas sloshing, the velocity inferred
  from the equation of state of the excess hot gas is comparable to the adiabatic
  sound speed expected for the 20 keV intracluster medium. All of the results support
  that the southeast substructure is created by a merger. On the other hand, the positional
  offset between the mass and the gas limits the self-interaction cross section of
  dark matter to be less than 3.7 h $^-1$ cm$^2$ g$^-1$ (95% CL).
