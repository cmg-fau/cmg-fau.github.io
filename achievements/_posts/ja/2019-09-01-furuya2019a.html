abstract: We investigate the evolution of the ortho-to-para ratio of overall (gas
  + ice) \\\H\\\$_2$ via the nuclear spin conversion on grain surfaces coated with
  water ice under physical conditions that are relevant to star- and planet-forming
  regions. We utilize the rate equation model that considers adsorption of gaseous
  \\\H\\\$_2$ on grain surfaces, which have a variety of binding sites with a different
  potential energy depth, thermal hopping, desorption, and the nuclear spin conversion
  of adsorbed \\\H\\\$_2$. It is found that the spin conversion efficiency depends
  on the \\\H\\\$_2$ gas density and the surface temperature. As a general trend,
  enhanced \\\H\\\$_2$ gas density reduces the efficiency, while the temperature dependence
  is not monotonic; there is a critical surface temperature at which the efficiency
  is the maximum. At low temperatures, the exchange of gaseous and icy \\\H\\\$_2$
  is inefficient (i.e., adsorbed \\\H\\\$_2$ does not desorb and hinders another gaseous
  \\\H\\\$_2$ to be adsorbed), while at warm temperatures, the residence time of \\\H\\\$_2$
  on surfaces is too short for the spin conversion. Additionally, the spin conversion
  becomes more efficient with lowering the activation barriers for thermal hopping.
  We discuss whether the spin conversion on surfaces can dominate over that in the
  gas phase in star- and planet-forming regions. Finally, we establish a simple, but
  accurate way to implement the \\\H\\\$_2$ spin conversion on grain surfaces in existing
  gas-ice astrochemical models.
