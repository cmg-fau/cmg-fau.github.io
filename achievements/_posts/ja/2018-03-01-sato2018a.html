abstract: Glycine, the simplest amino acid, has been intensively searched for in molecular
  clouds, and the comprehensive clarification of the formation path of interstellar
  glycine is now imperative. Among all the possible glycine formation pathways, we
  focused on the radical pathways revealed by Garrod (2013). In the present study,
  we have precisely investigated all the chemical reaction steps related to the glycine
  formation processes based on state- of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
  We found that two reaction pathways require small activation barriers (\ensuremathΔE$^†dbl$
  \ensuremathłeq 7.75 kJ mol$^-1$), which demonstrates the possibility of glycine
  formation even at low temperatures in interstellar space if the radical species
  are generated. The origin of carbon and nitrogen in the glycine backbone and their
  combination patterns are further discussed in relation to the formation mechanisms.
  According to the clarification of the atomic correspondence between glycine and
  its potential parental molecules, it is shown that the nitrogen and two carbons
  in the glycine can originate in three common interstellar molecules, methanol, hydrogen
  cyanide, and ammonia, and that the source molecules of glycine can be described
  by any of their combinations. The glycine formation processes can be categorized
  into six patterns. Finally, we discussed two other glycine formation pathways expected
  from the present DFT calculation results. <P />
