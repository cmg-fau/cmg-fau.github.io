abstract: Recent observations of the cosmic microwave background by the Wilkinson
  Microwave Anisotropy Probe strongly suggest that the reionization of the universe
  took place quite early (zåisebox-0.5ex~17). On the other hand, it has been pointed
  out that the cold dark matter cosmology suffers from a substructure problem in which
  more subgalactic halos are produced in the Local Group than dwarf galaxies. In this
  Letter, as a potential mechanism for solving this problem, we consider the feedback
  effects of early reionization on the formation of small-scale structures. For this
  purpose, we perform three- dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations, incorporating
  the radiative transfer for ionizing photons. As a result, it is found that the early
  reionization is devastating for low-mass systems with M$_vir$&lt;\i̊sebox-0.5ex~10$^8$
  M$_solar$ or v$_circ$&lt;\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~20 km s$^-1$, and almost all gas is photoevaporated
  in more than 95% of low-mass systems. Such a strong negative feedback on the formation
  of low-mass galaxies may solve the substructure problem and support the picture
  that Local Group dwarf galaxies are descendants of the more massive halos that experienced
  and survived tidal stripping.
