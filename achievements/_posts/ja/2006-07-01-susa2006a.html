abstract: We explore the possibility of subsequent star formation after a first star
  forms in a Population III object, by focusing on the radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD)
  feedback caused by ionizing photons, as well as H$_2$-dissociating photons. For
  this purpose, we perform three-dimensional RHD simulations in which the radiative
  transfer of ionizing photons and H$_2$-dissociating photons from a first star is
  self- consistently coupled with hydrodynamics based on a smoothed particle hydrodynamics
  method. It is shown that density peaks above a threshold density can keep collapsing,
  owing to the shielding of H$_2$-dissociating radiation by an H$_2$ shell formed
  ahead of a D-type ionization front. But, below the threshold density an M-type ionization
  front with a shock propagates, and density peaks are radiation-hydrodynamically
  evaporated by the shock. The threshold density depends on the distance from the
  source star and is åisebox-0.5ex~10$^2$ cm$^-3$ for a source distance of 30 pc.
  Taking into consideration that the extent of a Population III object is \i̊sebox-0.5ex~100
  pc and the density peaks within it have densities of 10$^2$-10$^4$ cm$^-3$, it is
  concluded that secondary star formation is possible in the broad regions of a Population
  III object.
