abstract: We investigate a non-equilibrium ionization state and an electron-ion two-temperature
  structure of the intracluster medium (ICM) in merging galaxy clusters using a series
  of N-body and hydrodynamic simulations. Mergers with various sets of mass ratios
  and impact parameters are systematically investigated, and it is found that, in
  most cases, ICM significantly departs from the ionization equilibrium state at the
  shock layers with a Mach number of ̃1.5-2.0 in the outskirts of the clusters, and
  the shock layers with a Mach number of ̃2-4 in front of the ICM cores. Accordingly,
  the intensity ratio between FeXXV and FeXXVI K\ensuremathα line emissions is significantly
  altered from that in the ionization equilibrium state. If the effect of the two-temperature
  structure of ICM is incorporated, the electron temperature is ̃10%-20% and ̃30%-50%
  lower than the mean temperature of ICM at the shock layers in the outskirts and
  in front of the ICM cores, respectively, and the deviation from the ionization equilibrium
  state becomes larger. We also address the dependence of the intensity ratio on the
  viewing angle with respect to the merging plane.
