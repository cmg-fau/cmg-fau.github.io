abstract: Using stacks of Ly\ensuremathα images of 2128 Ly\ensuremathα emitters (LAEs)
  and 24 proto-cluster UV- selected galaxies (LBGs) at z = 3.1, we examine the surface
  brightness profiles of Ly\ensuremathα haloes around high-z galaxies as a function
  of environment and UV luminosity. We find that the slopes of the Ly\ensuremathα
  radial profiles become flatter as the Mpc-scale LAE surface density increases, but
  that they are almost independent of the central UV luminosity. The characteristic
  exponential scalelength of the Ly\ensuremathα haloes appears to be proportional
  to the square of the LAE surface density (r Ly \ensuremathα\ensuremath∝\ensuremathΣ
  LAE 2). Including the diffuse, extended Ly\ensuremathα haloes, the rest-frame Ly\ensuremathα
  equivalent width of the LAEs in the densest regions approaches EW$_0$ ̃ 200 ̊A,
  the maximum value expected for young (&lt;10$^7$ yr) galaxies. This suggests that
  Ly\ensuremathα photons formed via shock compression by gas outflows or cooling radiation
  by gravitational gas inflows may partly contribute to the illumination of Ly\ensuremathα
  haloes; however, most of their Ly\ensuremathα luminosity can be explained by photoionization
  by or by scattering of Ly\ensuremathα photons produced from H II regions in and
  around the central galaxies. Regardless of the source of Ly\ensuremathα photons,
  if the Ly\ensuremathα haloes trace the overall gaseous structure, following the
  dark matter distribution, it is not surprising that the Ly\ensuremathα spatial extent
  depends more strongly on the surrounding Mpc-scale environment than on the activity
  of the central galaxies.
