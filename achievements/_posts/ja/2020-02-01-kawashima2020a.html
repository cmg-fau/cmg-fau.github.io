abstract: We carry out axisymmetric two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations
  of super-critical accretion columns on to strongly magnetized neutron stars. The
  effect of the strong magnetic field is taken into account by inhibiting the fluid
  motion across the radial magnetic field of the neutron stars. It is found that the
  high-density matter falls on to the neutron star along the sidewall of the column.
  Within the column, two high- density inflow regions shaped like a hollow cone are
  found for the case of extremely high mass accretion rates, \\dot\M\\/(L_Edd/c\ \2̂)
  \ensuremath∼ 5× 10$^2$, where \dot\M\, L_Edd, and c are the mass accretion rate
  on to the neutron star, the Eddington luminosity, and the speed of light, respectively.
  The less dense matter in the gap between the high density inflow regions is blown
  away via the radiative force. The resultant structure of the inflow looks like a
  triple hollow cone. Matter falls on to the neutron star only through the sidewall
  for the case of moderately high mass accretion rates, \\dot\M\\/(L_Edd/c\ \\)̂ \\ensuremath∼
  3 × 10\^.̂ A low-density outflow fills the interior of the column. In this case,
  the inflow structure looks like a single hollow cone. Although the copious photons
  are generated in the inflow regions via a shock, the photons escape from the sidewall
  of the column and the radiation force does not prevent inflow. The resulting luminosity
  of the sidewall exceeds \ensuremath∼ 30 times the Eddington luminosity for neutron
  stars, which is consistent with the observed luminosity of ultra-luminous X-ray
  pulsars.
