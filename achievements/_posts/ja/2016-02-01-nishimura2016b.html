abstract: Spectral line survey observations of seven molecular clouds in the Large
  Magellanic Cloud (LMC) have been conducted in the 3 mm band with the Mopra 22 m
  telescope to reveal chemical compositions in low metallicity conditions. Spectral
  lines of fundamental species such as CS, SO, CCH, HCN, HCO$^+$, and HNC are detected
  in addition to those of CO and $^13$CO, while CH$_3$OH is not detected in any source
  and N$_2$H$^+$ is marginally detected in two sources. The molecular-cloud scale
  (10 pc scale) chemical composition is found to be similar among the seven sources
  regardless of different star formation activities, and hence, it represents the
  chemical composition characteristic of the LMC without influences by star formation
  activities. In comparison with chemical compositions of Galactic sources, the characteristic
  features are (1) deficient N-bearing molecules, (2) abundant CCH, and (3) deficient
  CH$_3$OH. Feature (1) is due to a lower elemental abundance of nitrogen in the LMC,
  whereas features (2) and (3) seem to originate from extended photodissociation regions
  and warmer temperature in cloud peripheries due to a lower abundance of dust grains
  in the low metallicity condition. In spite of general resemblance of chemical abundances
  among the seven sources, the CS/HCO$^+$ and SO/HCO$^+$ ratios are found to be slightly
  higher in a quiescent molecular cloud. An origin of this trend is discussed in relation
  to possible depletion of sulfur along the molecular cloud formation.
