abstract: Based upon a novel paradigm of galaxy formation under the influence of an
  ultraviolet background, the evolutionary bifurcation of pre- galactic clouds is
  compared with observations of elliptical and spiral galaxies. The theory predicts
  that the dichotomy between dissipational and dissipationless galaxy formation stems
  from the degree of self-shielding from the ultraviolet background radiation. This
  is demonstrated on a bifurcation diagram of collapse epochs versus masses of pre-galactic
  clouds. Using the observed properties, the collapse epochs and mass are assessed
  for each type of galaxy. By direct comparison of the theory with observations, it
  turns out that the theoretical bifurcation branch successfully discriminates between
  elliptical and spiral galaxies. This suggests that the ultraviolet background radiation
  could play a profound role in the differentiation of galactic morphology into the
  Hubble sequence.
