abstract: Using two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we investigated the
  gas dynamics around a black hole (BH) plunging into a molecular cloud. In these
  calculations, we assumed a parallel- magnetic-field layer in the cloud. The size
  of the accelerated region is far larger than the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton radius, being
  approximately inversely proportional to the Alfvén Mach number for the plunging
  BH. Our results successfully reproduce the “Y” shape in position-velocity maps of
  the “Bullet” in the W44 molecular cloud. The size of the Bullet is also reproduced
  within an order of magnitude using a reasonable parameter set. This consistency
  supports the shooting model of the Bullet, according to which an isolated BH plunged
  into a molecular cloud to form a compact broad-velocity-width feature.
