abstract: 'Context. Hot corinos are extremely rich in complex organic molecules (COMs).
  Accurate abundance measurements of COMs in such objects are crucial to constrain
  astrochemical models. In the particular case of close binary systems this can only
  be achieved through high angular resolution imaging. <BR /> Aims: We aim to perform
  an interferometric study of multiple COMs in NGC 1333 IRAS 4A, which is a protostellar
  binary hosting hot corino activity, at an angular resolution that is sufficient
  to distinguish easily the emission from the two cores separated by 1.8``. <BR />
  Methods: We used the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimeter Array (ALMA) in its 1.2 mm band
  and the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) at 2.7 mm to image, with an angular
  resolution of 0.5'''' (120 au) and 1`` (235 au), respectively, the emission from
  11 different organic molecules in IRAS 4A. This allowed us to clearly disentangle
  A1 and A2, the two protostellar cores. For the first time, we were able to derive
  the column densities and fractional abundances simultaneously for the two objects,
  allowing us to analyse the chemical differences between them. <BR /> Results: Molecular
  emission from organic molecules is concentrated exclusively in A2, while A1 appears
  completely devoid of COMs or even simpler organic molecules, such as HNCO, even
  though A1 is the strongest continuum emitter. The protostellar core A2 displays
  typical hot corino abundances and its deconvolved size is 70 au. In contrast, the
  upper limits we placed on COM abundances for A1 are extremely low, lying about one
  order of magnitude below prestellar values. The difference in the amount of COMs
  present in A1 and A2 ranges between one and two orders of magnitude. Our results
  suggest that the optical depth of dust emission at these wavelengths is unlikely
  to be sufficiently high to completely hide a hot corino in A1 similar in size to
  that in A2. Thus, the significant contrast in molecular richness found between the
  two sources is most probably real. We estimate that the size of a hypothetical hot
  corino in A1 should be less than 12 au. <BR /> Conclusions: Our results favour a
  scenario in which the protostar in A2 is either more massive and/or subject to a
  higher accretion rate than A1, as a result of inhomogeneous fragmentation of the
  parental molecular clump. This naturally explains the smaller current envelope mass
  in A2 with respect to A1 along with its molecular richness. The extremely low abundances
  of organic molecules in A1 with respect to those in A2 demonstrate that the dense
  inner regions of a young protostellar core lacking hot corino activity may be poorer
  in COMs than the outer protostellar envelope. <P />The reduced datacube is only
