abstract: The importance of the activation energy of surface diffusion (E$_sd$) of
  adsorbed molecules on amorphous solid water (ASW) has been widely discussed in terms
  of chemical reactions on ASW at low temperatures. However, in previous work, E$_sd$
  has not been measured directly but estimated from indirect experiments. It has been
  assumed in chemical network calculations that E$_sd$ is between 0.3 and 0.8 of the
  desorption energies of a molecule. It remains important to obtain direct measurements
  of E$_sd$. We performed in situ observations of the deposition process of CO and
  CO$_2$ on ASW using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and deduced the E$_sd$
  of CO and CO$_2$ on ASW to be 350 \ensuremath± 50 and 1500 \ensuremath± 100 K, respectively.
  The value of E$_sd$ of CO is approximately 0.3 of the total adsorption energy of
  CO on ASW, I.e., much smaller than assumed in chemical network calculations, where
  the corresponding figure is 575 K, assuming approximately 0.5 of the desorption
  energy. We demonstrated that TEM is very useful not only for the observation of
  ices but also for the measurement of some physical properties that are relevant
  in astrochemistry and astrophysics. Using the E$_sd$ of CO measured in the present
  study (350 K), we have updated the chemical network model of Furuya et al., confirming
  that CO$_2$ could be efficiently formed by the reaction CO + OH \textrightarrow
  CO$_2$ + H in the initial stages of the evolution of molecular clouds.
