abstract: Ultra-high resolution hydrodynamic simulations using 1024$^3$ grid points
  are performed of a very large supernova burst in a forming galaxy, with properties
  similar to those inferred for Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). Explosions produce kpc-sized
  expanding hot bubbles enclosed by cool, dense shells, and the engulfed gas is polluted
  with freshly-synthesised heavy elements. We show that the resultant inhomogeneous
  mixing produces a large spread ([Fe/H] åisebox-0.5ex~ -1 to -5) of metallicities,
  which affects the subsequent galactic chemical evolution and leaves its imprint
  on metal-poor stars. By combining a spectral synthesis model with the numerical
  results, we predict Ly\ensuremathα emission from such galaxy at z=3. We find that
  the simulated galaxy, whose peak star formation rate is \i̊sebox-0.5ex~200M$_[[mdot]]$yr$^-1$,
  produces a Ly\ensuremathα luminosity L$_\ensuremathα$= 9.7×10$^42$ergs$^-1$. This
  value favorably matches the observed one, but some discrepancies are left for the
  Ly\ensuremathα line width, the metallicity, and X-ray properties. Since the results
  of the simulation is applicable only at the very early epoch of the galaxy formation,
  the metallicity is still lower than that of LBGs. However, the analysis presented
  here demonstrates a way to enable a systematic comparison with observational data.
  It is concluded that LBGs are optimal objects to scrutinise the early self- enrichment
  in forming galaxies. In the future, the predicted bubbly structure carved by SNe
  may be directly detected by high resolution observations with JWST. <P />
