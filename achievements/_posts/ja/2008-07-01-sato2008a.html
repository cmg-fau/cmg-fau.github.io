abstract: We consider the effect of a supernova (SN) explosion in a very massive binary
  that is expected to form in a portion of Population III stars with the mass higher
  than 100M$_solar$. In a Population III binary system, a more massive star can result
  in the formation of a black hole (BH) and a surrounding accretion disc. Such BH
  accretion could be a significant source of the cosmic reionization in the early
  Universe. However, a less massive companion star evolves belatedly and eventually
  undergoes a SN explosion, so that the accretion disc around a BH might be blown
  off in a lifetime of companion star. In this paper, we explore the dynamical impact
  of a SN explosion on an accretion disc around a massive BH, and elucidate whether
  the BH accretion disc is totally demolished or not. For the purpose, we perform
  three- dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a very massive binary system, where
  we assume a BH of 10$^3$M$_solar$ that results from a direct collapse of a very
  massive star and a companion star of 100M$_solar$ that undergoes a SN explosion.
  We calculate the remaining mass of a BH accretion disc as a function of time. As
  a result, it is found that a significant portion of gas disc can survive through
  three-dimensional geometrical effects even after the SN explosion of a companion
  star. Even if the SN explosion energy is higher by two orders of magnitude than
  the binding energy of gas disc, about a half of disc can be left over. The results
  imply that the Population III BH accretion disc can be a long-lived luminous source,
  and therefore could be an important ionizing source in the early Universe.
