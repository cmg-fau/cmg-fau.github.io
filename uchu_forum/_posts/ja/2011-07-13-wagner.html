<p>
Relativistic jets emerging from the nuclei of active galaxies can have a substantial influence on the history of star formation in bright galaxies. 
The interaction between the jet and the inhomogeneous ISM leaves a signature of highly disturbed and outflowing gas, which is a target for multi-wavelength observations, including optical IFU observations relating to AGN feedback. 
I shall present an analysis of the results of recently published simulations, which show the effects of different-powered jets on the inhomogeneous ISM of evolving galaxies early in the lifetime of the radio source.
