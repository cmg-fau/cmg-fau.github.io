<p> The Hydrogen Lyman-alpha line is a prominent spectral feature of star-forming galaxies. Over the last 15 years, several thousands of galaxies have been discovered thanks to their Lyman-alpha emission over the redshift range z = 2 to 7, tracing the formation and evolution of galaxies from ~1Gyr to 3Gyr after the Big Bang. Because of its resonnant nature, the Lyman-alpha line imprints the physical conditions of the interstellar and intergalactic gas it travels through. Thanks to radiation transfer studies, I will present how constraints on the kinematics, geometry, orientation of high-redshift galaxies may be derived from their observed Lyman-alpha properties. <p/>
