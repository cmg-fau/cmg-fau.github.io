Kiloparsec-scale outflows of gas and dust are thought to be an important mechanism in regulating star formation in galaxies and increasing the metallicity of circumgalactic and intergalactic media. In the past two decades, outflows have been discovered in numerous galaxies with vigorous star formation (starburst) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the local Universe to highest redshifts. Molecular outflows in particular draw attention. Since stars form predominantly in molecular clouds, the fate of molecular gas is crucial for galaxy evolution. In this talk, I present some recent observations using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) focused on revealing the properties of molecular outflows in resolved, nearby starburst galaxies, and new methods and results of searching for molecular outflows at high redshift.
