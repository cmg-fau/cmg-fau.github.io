<p>Leading computational scientists and HPC technologists will offer instruction on a variety of topics, including: HPC challenges by discipline (e.g., earth, life and materials sciences, physics)</p>
<ul>
  <li> HPC programming proficiencies</li>
  <li> Performance analysis & profiling</li>
  <li> Algorithmic approaches &numerical libraries</li>
  <li> Data-intensive computing</li>
  <li> Scientific visualization</li>
  <li> Canadian, EU, Japanese and U.S. HPC-infrastructures</li>
</ul>

<p>The expense-paid program will benefit advanced scholars from Canadian, European, Japanese and U.S. institutions who use HPC to conduct research.  Meals, housing, and travel will be covered for the selected participants.</p>  

<p>Applications from graduate students and postdocs in all science and engineering fields are welcome.  Preference will be given to applicants with parallel programming experience, and a research plan that will benefit from the utilization of high performance computing systems.</p>

<p>Interested people should apply by March 11, 2015.</p>
