<p>The Galaxy-IGM Workshop will be held again this year.</ p>

<p>For the past 10 years, the Galaxy-IGM Workshop has been held to share and discuss research results from galaxy observation / theory, IGM observation / theory, and AGN observation / theory, and to develop new collaborative research projects. This workshop has fostered many a student and postdoc to continue to become first-class researchers and teachers. </p> 

<p> As in the previous year, due to COVID-19, the workshop will be held online. The program includes, in addition to invited and contributed talks, group work by graduate students and postdocs, a format that was successfully employed in the past two years. We look forward to your participation. </p>


<p>This workshop is supported by the Kenkyukai-kaisai-shien Program of the Center for Computational Science, University of Erlangen-Nürnberg. </p>
