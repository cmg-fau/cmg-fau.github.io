<p>The Galaxy-IGM workshop 2019 will be held at the Kitami Institute of Technology from the 5 - 9 August 2019. In this workshop, we are planning to organize a special panel discussion about future missions of Subaru, ALMA, SKA, JWST, and numerical simulations and the synergy between these. 

<p>In this workshop, we are planning to organize a summer school 
for young people. We will have a series of six special lectures 
on the 1st and 2nd days given by distinguished scientists for 
theoretical/observational studies on galaxy formation, IGM/CGM, and/or AGN. 
The participants will be asked to have discussion on some topics/questions 
that will be provided by the lecturers and give a presentation 
to share their ideas/answers on the 5th day.</p>

<p>We recommend that participants of the summer school come to Kitami 
before the 1st day, because on the 1st day it will start in the morning. </p>

<p>Regular scientific talks will be assigned mainly on the 3rd and 4th days. 
The workshop will be finished around the noon on the 5th day. </p>

<p>This workshop is supported by the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg, Center for Nanoanalysis and Electron Microscopy "研究集会開催支援プログラム".</p>
