<p>Galaxy Formation spans cosmic time, beginning with the formation first generation objects (i.e. Population III), cosmic background radiation, protogalaxy formation, active galactic nuclei formation, and galaxy evolution. In recent years, the study of the fundamental physics in these processes has progressed greatly. In addition, intimately related topics such as the problem of metal contamination and re-ionization of the intergalactic medium are being examined in detail. This workshop offers a timely opportunity to discuss in a comprehensive manner all the physics involved in galaxy formation.</p>
