<p>At the beginning of my talk, I will introduce the faculty members of the UNLV astrophysics group, for the students who might be interested in visiting us for collaborative research. Our research interests match quite well with those of CCS at Tsukuba. There are many methods and targets to study structure formation at high redshift. Two of the useful observational probes are the damped Ly-alpha systems (DLAs) and Ly-alpha emitters (LAEs), both of which are already detected over 500 in number. We have been studying the properties of DLAs and LAEs using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations over the past few years. Through our modeling, the effects of radiation from both UV background and the local stellar population has become one of the central issues. In particular the escape fraction of ionizing photons is determined by the distribution of neutral gas in high-z galaxies. I will present our preliminary results of radiative transfer calculations from local stellar populations and their implications on the properties of DLAs &amp; LAEs.</p>
