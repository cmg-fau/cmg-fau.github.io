<p>Narrow Line Seyfert 1s (NLS1) are the lowest mass, highest mass accretion rate Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the local Universe, with black hole masses of 1-10 million x Msun, accreting at the Eddington limit or beyond. These properties are similar to those expected for the majority of the first quasars in the early Universe, so I will show how understanding the accretion flow in these local NLS1 can guide our predictions for what we can see of the cosmic dawn, at z greater than 6-7.</p>
