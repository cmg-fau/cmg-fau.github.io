<p>In the formation process of galaxies, AGN jets are thought to have the important function of feeding energy and momentum back into the halo of the host galaxies and dispersing the gas within. The set of 14 realistic 3-D simulations that we have recently performed quantitatively demonstrate the efficiency of jet feedback as functions of the jet power and the porosity and density of the two- phase ISM in the galaxy halo. Porous channels in the halo ISM divert some of the jet plasma away from its main propagation axis, inflating a quasi-spherical energy-driven bubble that provides the momentum to disperse gas to velocities comparable to those seen in recent observations of forming galaxies.</p>
