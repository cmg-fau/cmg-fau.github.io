<p>So far, there are several indications supporting the existence of black holes, but for sure no smoking gun. The possible observation and study of the shadow of the black hole in the Galactic Center could confirm the black hole paradigm and permit tests of GR in the strong field regime. In this talk, I will focus the attention on the test of the relation a &lt; M and the possibility of the existence of objects more compact than standard black holes.</p>
