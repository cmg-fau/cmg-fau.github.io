<p>The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) shaped the properties of the baryonic content of the Universe. Using hydrodynamical and radiative-transfer numerical simulations, we investigate in detail the processes taking place in the IGM before, during and after the EoR. Present and future observations by, e.g., PAPER, LOFAR, SKA, and E-ELT, will enable comparisons between theoretical predictions and observations, yielding tight constraints on the properties of the universe during the EoR.</p>
