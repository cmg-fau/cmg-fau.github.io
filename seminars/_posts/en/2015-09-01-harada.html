<p>
The molecular composition in star-forming regions in the Milky Way is useful, for example, for determining the current stage of star-formation of a system. In starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN), the molecular composition is thought to vary strongly. In the past few years, ALMA observations of multiple species have revealed the differences in these systems on GMC scales. We perform molecular chemical network calculations and predict the chemical composition of star-forming regions near AGN. We also discuss the regions of hot dust found in (ultra-) luminous infrared galaxies by comparing our predictions with observation.
