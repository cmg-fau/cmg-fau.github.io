<p>This talk will highlight some progress made based on our efforts of computing the universe, in order to understand the dynamics of gas in the universe, from intergalactic to interstellar medium.  Select observables presented include the cosmic web from redshift zero to z=2-4,  and the escape fraction of Lyman continuum photons from galaxies at the epoch of reionization, an essential parameter underlying the feasibility of stellar reionization of the universe.</p>
